'''April''' is the 4th [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It is one of four months to have 30 [[day]]s.

April always begins on the same day of week as [[July]], and additionally, [[January]] in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as [[December]].

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==
[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year.

April begins on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year and on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year, as each others' last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.

In [[common year|common years]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s, [[May]] of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as [[July]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[February]] and [[October]] of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[June]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[March]] and June of the following year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

'''August''' (Aug.) is the 8th [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

August doesn't begin on the same day of the week as any other month in [[Common year|common years]], but begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[Leap year|leap years]].  August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]].

No other month in [[common year|common years]] begins on the same day of the week as August, but August begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August ends on the same day of the week as [[November]] every year, as each others' last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.

In common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[June]] of the previous year. In common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as March and June of the previous year, and in leap years, [[September]] of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, August starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[October]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[February]] and October of the following year.

'''Art''' is a creative activity by people.  These people are called [[artist]]s.  They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Artists express themselves by their art. Some people find art relaxing. Many people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. 

Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.
* Plastic arts
** Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]]
** Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]
* Performing arts
** Performing art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]])
** Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
* Practical arts
** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
** The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])

== What &quot;art&quot; means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]].  An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired.

The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design. 

Art may express [[emotion]].  Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an [[audience]].  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the [[Upper Palaeolithic|Upper Paleolithic]] era.

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient India|India]], [[Ancient China|China]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Persia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronze, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her &quot;[[talent]]&quot; and industry into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist, protected by [[copyright]].

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) Cognitive function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) Aesthetic function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) Prognostic function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic function

:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

: ''This page is about the first [[letter]] in the [[alphabet]].''
: ''For the indefinite article, see [[Article (grammar)]].''
: ''For other uses of A, see [[A (disambiguation)]]''

{{A-Z}}
[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, '''a''', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long '''a''' (ā) is said as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]]. A capital a is written &quot;A&quot;. Use a capital a at the start of a sentence if trying to communicate.

==Where it came from==
The earliest letter 'A' has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet's [[aleph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; This symbol came from a simple picture of an [[ox]] head. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;&quot;
! Egyptian
! Phoenician &lt;br&gt;''[[aleph]]''
! Greek &lt;br&gt;''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''
! Etruscan &lt;br&gt;A
! Roman/Cyrillic &lt;br&gt;A
|- style=&quot;background-color:white; text-align:center;&quot;
|[[File:EgyptianA-01.svg|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]
|[[File:PhoenicianA-01.svg|Phoenician aleph]]
|[[File:Alpha uc lc.svg|65px|Greek alpha]]
|[[File:EtruscanA.svg|Etruscan A]]
|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

==Using the letter==
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word ''pad''. Other sounds of this letter are in the words ''father'', which developed into another sound, such as in the word ''ace''.

==Use in mathematics==
In algebra, the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.

'''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]].  It has [[mass]] and [[weight]], because it is [[matter]].  The weight of air creates [[atmosphere pressure|atmospheric  pressure]].  There is no air in [[outer space]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 0.9% [[argon]], 0.04% [[carbon dioxide]], and very small amounts of other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013). Earth’s Oxygen: a mystery easy to take for granted. New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an average of about 1% water vapour.

Animals live by [[aerobic respiration]] and need to breathe the oxygen in the air. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s put oxygen into the [[blood]], and send back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off the oxygen that we breathe.   

[[Wind]] is moving air. This causes [[weather]]. 

Air [[air pollution|can be polluted]] by some gases (such as [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and ash. This [[air pollution]] causes various problems including [[acid rain]] and [[global warming]].

Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]]. [[Pneumatics]] use [[air pressure]] to move things.

{{shortcut|WP:ADMIN|WP:SYSOP|WP:A|WP:MOP}}
[[File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg|thumbnail|This is the symbol of a Wikipedia administrator. It shows the site's logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]]
'''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.

''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''

=== Administrative tools ===
==== Delete ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].

=====Revision Delete=====
Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].

==== Protect ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] (.js or .css) files.
* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.

==== Block ====
Administrators can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.

* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different than bans.

==== Rollback ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:

:'''m''' ''Reverted edits by '''User A''' ('''talk''') to last version by '''User B'''

To use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].
* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].

==== Import pages ====
They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.

==== View unwatched pages ====
They can see which pages are not on someone's watchlist.

==== Manage userrights ====
They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, flooder, the uploader right, and the patroller right for all accounts.

== Bureaucrat ==
{{shortcut|WP:CRAT|WP:BUR}}
A '''bureaucrat''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also &quot;flag&quot; and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. These requests were handled on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]]. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for [[:m:SUL finalization|SUL finalization]]. Now, these requests should be made at [[:m:SRUC|Meta-Wiki]] or on this [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|special page]] where stewards and global renamers will handle them.

== CheckUser ==
A select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].

== Oversighter ==
Certain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the [[United States]] of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called &quot;historic communities&quot;: Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the sole official language in every autonomous community but six, where Spanish is co-official with other languages, as follows:
* [[Catalonia]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]]
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
* [[Galicia]]: [[Galician language|Galician]]
* [[:en:Basque_Country|Basque Country]]: [[Basque language|Basque]]
* [[Navarre]]: [[basque language|Basque]] (only in the north and near the border with the Basque County)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[:en:Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander, Spain|Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and León]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called &quot;autonomous cities&quot; and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumb|right|A rebuild of a machine made by Alan Turing]]

'''Alan Mathison Turing''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[FRS]] ([[London]], 23 June 1912 – [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], 7 June 1954) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Young Life and Family ==
Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father was part of a family of [[Merchant|merchants]] from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the [[daughter]] of an [[engineer]].

=== Education ===
Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was six years old.

== Career ==
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]]. 

Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called &quot;[[Intelligence|intelligent]]&quot;. A computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, Stevan 2008.  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Turing worked to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). Using [[cryptanalysis]], he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he solved other German codes.

From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was &quot;the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.

== Private life ==
Turing was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, [[homosexual]] acts were illegal. Turing was [[conviction|convicted]]. He had to choose between going to [[jail]] and taking [[hormone]]s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his punishment, he became [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. He also grew [[breast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author=Andrew Hodges | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, a [[private member's bill]] was put before the [[House of Lords]] to grant Turing a statutory [[pardon]].&lt;ref name=Guardian-Pardon&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary bill launched for Alan Turing pardon|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/25/alan-turing-private-members-bill-lord-sharkey|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the government supported it.&lt;ref name=turingguardian19july2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/19/enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-posthumous-pardon|title=Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing to be given posthumous pardon|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 July 2013|author=Nicholas Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal pardon was granted on 24&lt;!-- Mercy is effective from 24 December although it was announced on the night of 23rd --&gt; December 2013.&lt;ref name=turingindependent24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency' – 61 years after he poisoned himself|publisher=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|Author=Oliver Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turingpardoncryptome24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf|title=(Archived copy of) Royal Pardon for Alan Turing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In 1954, after suffering for two years, Turing died from [[cyanide]] poisoning. The cyanide came from either an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8&lt;/ref&gt;It is also suspected that he committed suicide. 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31&amp;nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 01&amp;nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition received thousands of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;The petition was only open to UK citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition. He called Turing's treatment &quot;appalling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PM's apology to codebreaker Alan Turing: we were inhumane | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/11/pm-apology-to-alan-turing | publisher=The Guardian| date = 11 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from [[France]] or [[Germany]] (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the [[United States|USA]] is the &quot;Cajun&quot; style. 

Other sorts are &quot;French andouille&quot; and &quot;German andouille&quot;; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

'''Farming''' is growing [[crop]]s or keeping animals by people for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].

Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Tudge argues &quot;from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'&quot;. Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p3. ISBN 0-297-84258-7&lt;/ref&gt; The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and became [[settler]]s in what became [[cities]].

Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. University College London Press. ISBN 1-56098-675-1&lt;/ref&gt; The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.

== Kinds of farming ==
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, animal hides ([[skin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or [[fur]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]]s , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]]).

Many people still live by [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm.  They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals.  The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low.  This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s.  Where yields are low, [[deforestation]] can provide new land to grow more food.  This provides more [[nutrition]] for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding [[environment]] over many years.

In rich countries, farms are often fewer and larger.  During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests.  Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land.  There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. 

This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.

=== Agriculture techniques ===
* [[Fertilizer]]s
* [[Crop rotation]]
* [[Weed]] removal
* [[Breeding]]
* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]
* [[Ranching]]
* [[Plantation]]

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value.  They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and drought, and are easier to harvest.  Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.

New plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide.

== Food ==
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.
* Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.
* Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. 
* Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. 
* Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.
* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.
* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.

== Problems in agriculture ==
There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.
These include:
* [[Erosion]]
* [[Diseases]]
* [[Pests]]
* [[Weed]]s
* [[Drought]]
* [[Rainfall]]

== Crops ==
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

*[[Maize]] 624 millions of metric tons
*[[Wheat]] 570 millions of metric tons
*[[Rice]] 381.1 millions of metric tons
*[[Cotton]] 96.5 millions of metric tons

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arithmetic''' is a name for working with [[number]]s. It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

Harder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].

Most people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. 

A [[calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic. [[Computer]]s can do it more quickly, which is one reason [[Global Positioning System]] receivers have a small computer inside. 

== Examples of arithmetic ==

* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)

* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)

* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)

* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)

[[Image:Addition.gif|thumb|220px|Addition ]]

'''Addition''' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.

== Arithmetic ==

In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is &quot;+&quot;. The name for the sign &quot;+&quot; is &quot;plus&quot;.  
Another name for the total is the [[sum]].

=== Counting examples ===
For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: &quot;o&quot;. One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  

====Adding====

Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:

:{{math|5 + 3}}

There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that:

:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}

In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.

'''Vertical Addition'''

The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).  First the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, the 3 is written below and the 1 ten is carried to the tens column. Next in the tens column the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, the 5 is written below and the 1 hundred is carried to the hundreds column. Finally in the hundreds column 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, the 2 is written below and the 1 thousand is carried to the thousand column. Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three.

===A measurement example===
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300 meters  east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120 meters east of Bob's house:

:Tom's house&lt;------------300 meters--------------&gt;Bob's house&lt;-----120 meters-----&gt;Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.
:{{math|{{aao|300|120|+}}}}

== Addition as increase ==
Addition can also mean to make bigger.

=== Example of addition as increase ===
* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.

* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is a [[food additive]] or addition to the food.

'''Australia''', officially called the '''Commonwealth of Australia''', is a [[country]] and [[sovereign state]] in the [[southern hemisphere]], located on its own [[continent]] between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. Its [[capital city]] is [[Canberra]], and its largest city is [[Sydney]].

Australia is the [[List of countries by area|sixth biggest country in the world]] by land area, and is part of the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[Australasia]]n regions. Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and other islands on the Australian [[tectonic plate]] are together called [[Australasia]], which is one of the world's great [[ecozone]]s. When other Pacific islands are included with Australasia, it is called [[Oceania]].

23{{ndash}}24 million people live in Australia, and about 80% of them live on the east coast. The country is divided up into six [[States of Australia|states]], and more than half of Australia's [[population]] lives in and around the cities of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]].

Australia is known for its [[mining]], its production of [[wool]], and as the world's largest producer of [[bauxite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mams.rmit.edu.au/0wzm6liriybr1.PDF|title=Alcola World Alumina Australia|publisher=MAMS.RMIT.edu.au|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle.

== Geography ==

[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]

Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Kate | year=2008 | title=National Geographic Australia | publisher=Horupu | location=Tokyo | page=pp.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in 1901. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

=== Regions and cities ===
{{Other pages|List of Cities in Australia}}
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cummins | first=Brian R. | year=1990 | title=Australia | publisher= the Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | pages= 16-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).

In 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 23.13 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Oceania South Pole | author= Tanabe Yu | year= 1997 | publisher= Asakura Bookstore | location= Shinjyuku ward | page= 3179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]

The [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Hesp, Patrick A. ''et al'' 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. ''Australian Archaeology'', No 49 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html |title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Australia colonized earlier than previously thought? |first= |last= |work=stonepages.com |year=2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The history of Australia |author=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004|publisher=Yuhikaku ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

=== Terra Australis ===
In the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find &quot;[[Terra Australis]]&quot; (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw &quot;New South Wales&quot;. At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

=== Settlement ===
[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was &quot;the finest harbor in the world!&quot; There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.

Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

=== Exploration ===
[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17-year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&amp;nbsp;miles from Sydney.

Some people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The [[Henty Brothers|Henty brothers]] had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

===Self government===

The gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.

The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===

Until 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the [[British Empire]], and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.

In Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.

Australia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.

In 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.

== Politics ==
[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]

Australia is made up of six [[state]]s and three mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]]. Each state and territory has its own [[Parliament]] and makes its own local [[law]]s. The [[Parliament of Australia]] sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or [[Federation]].

The [[Federation|Federal]] government is led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is [[Malcolm Turnbull]].

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] represents the Queen of Australia, who is also the Queen of Great Britain, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently [[His Excellency]] [[Peter Cosgrove|Sir Peter Cosgrove]], is chosen by the Prime Minister.

== Culture ==
[[File:Sydney Opera House Night.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The [[Sydney Opera House]] was officially opened in 1973.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Australia was [[Colonisation|colonised]] by people from [[Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New History of Australia |authors=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004 |publisher=ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=pp. 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but today people from all over the world live there. English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion, though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are encouraged to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians.

Famous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument. [[File:didgeridoo.jpg|thumb|[[didgeridoo]]]]

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (''Dame Edna Everage''), [[Steve Irwin]] (''The Crocodile Hunter'') and [[The Wiggles]]. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as [[Bogan Hunters]] and [[Kath &amp; Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/our-fascination-with-bogans-will-be-televised-25262 |title=&quot;Our fascination with &quot;Bogans&quot; will be televised&quot; |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |last=Smith |first=Michelle |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]''.

[[Australian cinema|Australian movies]] have a very long history. The world's first feature movie was the Australian movie ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang Video Overview The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', directed by [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]], had [[Errol Flynn]] as the main actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/ Video Overview In the Wake of the Bounty (1933) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/ Video Overview Kokoda Front Line! (1942) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with movies like ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', [[Gallipoli (1981 movie)|''Gallipoli'']] (with [[Mel Gibson]]), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 movie)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' and ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html &quot;Fair Dinkum Fillums&quot;: the Crocodile Dundee Phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] became global stars during the 1990s and ''[[Australia (2008 movie)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]] made a lot of money in 2008.

Australia is also a popular destination for business conferences and research, with Sydney named as one of the top 20 meeting destinations in the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesseventssydney.com.au/conferences/meet-in-sydney/|title=Meet in Sydney|newspaper=Business Events Sydney|access-date=2017-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sport ===
[[File:DonaldBradman.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Don Bradman]].]]

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndca.asn.au/other-information/about-australia/|title=About Australia|publisher=NDCA|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In international sports, Australia has very strong teams in [[cricket]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]], [[rowing]] and [[swimming]]. Local popular sports include [[Australian Rules Football]], horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 [[Commonwealth Games]] and are to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the [[Australian Open]], one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]]. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.

The main sporting leagues for males are the [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]] and [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|NBL]].
For women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] and [[WNBL]].

Famous Australian [[sports]] players include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].

=== Art festivals ===

Just 60 years ago, Australia had only one big art festival. Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals, and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/arts_festivals.html | title=Art festivals | author=Australian government | accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife ==
Australia is home to many animals that can be found nowhere else on Earth, which include: the [[koala]], the [[kangaroo]], the [[wombat]], the [[numbat]], the [[emu]], among many others. Most of the [[Marsupial|marsupials]] in the world are found only on the continent.[[File:Numbat.jpg|thumb|[[Numbat]]]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''American English''' or '''United States English''' is the [[dialect]] of [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States|United States of America]]. It is different in some ways from other types of English, such as [[British English]]. Many types of American English came from local dialects in England.

Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another sort of English is spoken. This may be because people hear and read American English through the [[mass media|media]], for example [[CNN]] television, and the [[Internet]], where the most common form of English is American English.

Because people all over the world use American English as well as other types of English, the English language gets new words. Because of this, English has been changing for hundreds of years. For example, the English language spoken in [[India]], which has more than one billion people, keeps adding more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from any of the 200+ Indian languages.

Sometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America. These people often keep using American English in everyday life.

The meaning of many words are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]] all came from [[Latin]].

== Spelling ==
There are many words that sound the same in both American English and British English, but are spelled differently.  For example:

*Words originally from French that end in &quot;-our&quot; in British English (behaviour, colour, honour, neighbour, etc.) end in &quot;-or&quot; in American English (behavior, color, honor, neighbor). 
&lt;br/&gt;Words of that come from French that end in -re in British English (metre, centre) end in -er in American English. In these cases [[Canadian]] usage is to keep the British (and French) spelling.
*Verbs that end in -ise in British English (criticise, realise) end in -ize in American English (criticize, organize, realize). However, the -ize ending is optional in British English, and is shown as an option in British dictionaries.
*One of the changes introduced by Noah Webster is the change of the double &quot;l&quot; from words like &quot;travelled&quot; to &quot;traveled&quot;. 

Books show that many of these differences come from the writings of English-lover [[Noah Webster]], who made the American dictionary following the [[American War of Independence]].

Some more differences in American English:
* aluminium is spelled &quot;aluminum&quot;
* doughnut is sometimes spelled &quot;donut&quot;
* draught is spelled &quot;draft&quot;
* gaol (not common) is spelled &quot;jail&quot;
* plough is spelled &quot;plow&quot;

== Vocabulary ==
There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English, e.g.:
* aeroplane is called &quot;airplane&quot;
* ladybird is called &quot;ladybug&quot;
* lift is called &quot;elevator&quot;
* toilet is called &quot;bathroom&quot;, &quot;restroom&quot; or &quot;comfort station&quot;
* lorry is called &quot;truck&quot;
* nappies are called &quot;diapers&quot;
* petrol is called &quot;gas&quot; (or &quot;gasoline&quot;)
* the boot of a car is called a &quot;trunk&quot;
* a dummy is called a &quot;pacifier&quot;
* trousers are called &quot;pants&quot;
* underground is called &quot;subway&quot;
* football is called &quot;soccer&quot;
* braces are &quot;suspenders&quot; (&quot;suspenders&quot; in British-English are a type of clothing worn around the lower leg by males to stop socks/sox from sagging, and around the upper leg by women wearing stockings)

== Regional accents ==
* '''R-dropping''' is a thing that occurs for English speakers in certain places where &quot;r&quot; sound is not pronounced after a [[vowel]]. For [[example]] as in the words &quot;car&quot; and &quot;card&quot; sounding like &quot;cah&quot; and &quot;cahd&quot;. This occurs in the Boston area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Delta Pride Catfish farm harvest.jpg|thumb|The Delta Pride Catfish farms.]]
'''Aquaculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]], and other seafood.  Aquaculture supplies fish, such as [[catfish]], [[salmon]], and [[trout]]. Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in [[China]] and aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. 

Aquaculture is quite a new activity in [[Canada]] as it only began in [[1879]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''abbreviation''' is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The [[English language]] occasionally uses the [[apostrophe]] mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use [[Period (punctuation)|periods]], especially the ones that come from the [[Latin]] language. Common Latin abbreviations include '''i.e.''' [id est] ''that is'', '''e.g.''' [exempli gratia] ''for example'', and '''et al.''' [et alia] ''and others''.

Some new abbreviations have been created by [[scientist]]s, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the [[Internet]].

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are [[acronym]]s.

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word &quot;[[radar]]&quot; is an [[acronym]] for &quot;Radio Detection and Ranging&quot;. The name of the large computer company [[IBM]] comes from the words &quot;International Business Machines&quot;.

[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Three angels, in a picture made in about 1420 by the Russian, Andrej Rublev.]]

In many mythologies and [[religion]]s, an '''angel''' is a good [[spirit]]. The word angel comes from the Greek word ''angelos'' which means &quot;messenger&quot;. Angels appear frequently in the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], [[Qur'an]] and [[Aqdas]].

==In the Bible==
Angels are powerful, smart spirits that obey God's commands and praise him with singing and they have [[male]] ([[masculine]])[[gender]], but without any sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:53}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes appear to [[human]]s in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can deliver messages to people in person or in [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels that are named in the [[Bible]] are [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (called a &quot;chief prince&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Gabriel]] (known for telling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] that she would be the mother of [[Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:26-38}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Raphael (in the [[Apocrypha]]l [[Book of Tobit]]).&lt;ref name=ABF&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=1603207783|pages=4-7, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ethiopia]]n [[Book of Enoch]] also lists four Archangels which watch over the four quadrants of heaven; Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible.

===Types===
*'''Cherubim''' (plural of cherub) are described as &quot;winged creatures&quot; which have four wings&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherubim guard the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] with a [[sword]] of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. Genesis 3:24 is found in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God.&lt;ref&gt;The IVP New Bible Commentary pp734 states: ' the exact significance of the cherub is unclear'&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezekiel 28:13-14
13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

It describes the sound of their wings, &quot;like the roar of rushing waters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings .

Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have &quot;straight feet&quot; and four wings and four faces.

Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16

Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be &quot;a wheel in the midst of a wheel&quot; and that the color of the wheels was the color of &quot;Amber&quot; Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there.

*'''Seraphim''' (plural of seraph, which means &quot;burning&quot;)they also are depicted having wings, six of them. They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the [[temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Archangels''' like Gabriel ([[Gospel of Luke]] 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered [[saint]]s in the [[Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=ABF/&gt; However, in the King James Version of the Bible; they are another type of angel. In the [[Book of Revelation]] the Angel Michael casts the 'great dragon' [[Satan]] out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels, just before the Great Judgement of angels and man. (Revelation 12)
*The [[Leviathan]] in [[Book of Job]] 41:19-21 has flame that goes:  'out of his mouth' like a [[dragon]].  Isaiah 30:6 also talks of a 'fiery flying serpent'. Compare Revelation 20:2: , where an angel: 'laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the [[Devil]], and Satan, and bound him a thousand years'.

==In art==
They are often shown in art as having wings and a [[halo]]. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness.

The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings.

The cherubim statue or [[bronze]] casting of cherubim in the Temple of [[Solomon]] depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making.

The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork, and was attempted by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]].

==Angelology==
The study of Angels is called Angelology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theology.edu/theology/angel.htm Angelology]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ad hominem''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a type of [[argument]]. It is a word often used in [[rhetoric]]. Rhetoric is the science of speaking well, and convincing other people of your [[idea]]s.

Translated to English, ''ad hominem'' means ''against the person''. In other words, when someone makes an ad hominem, they are [[attack]]ing the person they are arguing against, instead of what they are saying.

The term comes from the Latin word ''homo'', which means [[human]]. ''Hominem'' is a [[gender]] neutral version of the word ''homo''. In ancient [[Rome]] it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings.

Ad hominem can be a way to use [[reputation]], [[rumor]]s and [[hearsay]] to change the minds of other people listening. When a [[social network]] has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a negative [[label]] to them, this can work more often.

It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument. In [[court]]s and in [[diplomacy]] ad hominems are not appreciated.

Ad hominems are not wrong every time. For example, when people think that someone can't be [[Trust (social sciences)|trusted]], things that they have said previously can be [[doubt]]ed.

== What an ad hominem argument looks like ==
In [[logic]], a [[wikt:proof|proof]] is something that starts with [[premise]]s, and goes through a few logical [[argument]]s, to reach a [[conclusion]].

=== Normal (valid) proof ===
# All [[human]]s are mortal
# [[Socrates]] is a man (he is human)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

=== Ad hominem example ===
# Person A thinks [[abortion]] should be [[illegal]]
# Person A is uneducated and poor
# Therefore, abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

'''Native Americans''' (also called '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''', or '''Indigenous Peoples of America''') are the people, and their descendants, who were in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]] Islands when Europeans arrived. There are many different [[tribe]]s of Native American people, with many different languages. There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined. Approximately 51 million Native Americans live in [[Latin America]].

Sometimes these people are called &quot;Indians&quot;, but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from [[India]]. When [[Christopher Columbus]] was travelling [[West]], he did not know about the [[Americas]]. He thought he was going to [[West Indies]], so he called the people &quot;Indians&quot;. 

Many Native Americans died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from [[disease]]s that came with the Europeans that were new to the Native Americans, in [[battle]] with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as [[slave]]s. Most of the native people were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands.

The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from [[Asia]]. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when [[Alaska]] was connected to [[Siberia]] by the [[Bering land bridge]].

Some Native American tribes of North America are [[Cherokee]], [[Maya people|Maya]] or [[Yucatec]], [[Aztecs]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and [[Sioux]]. 

Some Native American tribes of South America are [[Aymara people|Aymara]], [[Guaraní people|Guarani]], [[Quechua]], and [[Tupi]].

The '''apple tree''' (''[[Malus]] domestica'') is a tree that sheds its trees in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] best known for its sweet, tasty fruit, the '''apple'''. It is grown worldwide as a fruit tree. 

The tree originated in [[Central Asia]]. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe. They were brought to [[North America]] by European settlers. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures.

Apples are generally propagated by [[grafting]], although wild apples grow readily from [[seed]]. Apple trees are large if grown from seed, but small if grafted onto [[roots]] (rootstock). There are more than 7,500 known [[cultivars]] of apples, with a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses: cooking, eating raw and [[cider]] production are the most common uses. 

Trees and fruit are attacked by [[fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[pests]].   In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[sequence analysis|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and [[selective breeding]] in apple production.

Worldwide production of apples in 2013 was 90.8 million tonnes. [[China]] grew 49% of the total.&lt;ref name=&quot;faostat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QC/E|publisher= FAOSTAT, UN Food &amp; Agriculture Organization, Statistics Division|title=Production/Crops, Apple, Area by World|date=2013|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical information ==
The apple has a small, leaf-shedding tree that grows up to {{convert|3|to|12|m}} tall. The apple tree has a broad crown with thick [[twig]]s.
The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] simple [[oval]]s. They are 5 to 12 [[centimeter|centimetres]] long and 3–6centimetres (1.2–2.4in) wide. It has a sharp top with a soft underside. [[Blossom]]s come out in [[spring]] at the same time that the leaves begin to bud. The [[flower]]s are white. They also have a slightly pink color. They are five [[petal]]ed, and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in [[wikt:diameter|diameter]]. The fruit [[wikt:maturity|matures]] in [[autumn]]. It is usually 5 to 9 centimetres (2.0 to 3.5 in) in diameter. There are five [[carpel]]s arranged in a [[star]] in the middle of the fruit. Every carpel has one to three [[seed]]s.

=== Wild ancestors ===
The wild [[ancestor]] of apple trees is ''[[Malus sieversii]]''. They grow wild in the [[mountain]]s of [[Central Asia]] in the north of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], [[People's Republic of China|China]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree&quot;/&gt; and possibly also ''Malus sylvestris''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coart&quot;/&gt; Unlike [[wikt:domestication|domesticated]] apples, their leaves become red in autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Archetti M. (2009).

PMID 19369261&lt;/ref&gt; They are being used recently to develop ''Malus domestica'' to grow in colder [[wikt:climate|climates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;app3&quot;/&gt;

==History==

The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated.&lt;ref name=app6/&gt; Its fruits have become better over thousands of years. It is said that [[Alexander the Great]] discovered [[wikt:small|dwarf]] apples in [[Asia Minor]] in 300 [[BC]]. [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years. From when [[Europe]]ans arrived, [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]] have used apples as food as well.&lt;ref name=app6&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch39.html
|title= An apple a day keeps the doctor away
|accessdate= 27 January 2008
|publisher=vegparadise.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apples were brought to [[North America]] in the 1600s. The first apple [[orchard]] on the North American continent was said to be near [[Boston]] in 1625. In the 1900s, costly fruit [[industry|industries]], where the apple was a very important species, began developing.&lt;ref name=app3/&gt;

== In culture ==
=== Paganism ===
[[Image:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|&quot;Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]&quot; (1901) by Carl Larsson]]

In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] gives apples to the gods in ''[[Prose Edda]]'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) that makes them young forever. English [[wikt:scholar|scholar]] H. R. Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to [[religion|religious]] practices in [[Germanic paganism]]. It was from there, she claims, that [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg [[ship]] in [[Norway]]. She also remarks that fruit and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] (Iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in ''Skáldskaparmál'') have been discovered in the early [[grave]]s of the [[Germanic peoples]] in [[England]]. They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe. She suggests that this may have had a [[symbol]]ic meaning. Nuts are still a symbol of [[fertility]] in Southwest England.

== Cooking ==
Sometimes apples are eaten after they are [[cooked]]. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into [[drink]]s. [[Apple juice]] and apple [[cider]] are apple drinks. 

The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a [[tool]] that removes the core, or by carefully using a [[knife]].

The [[scientific name]] of the apple tree genus in the [[Latin]] language is ''Malus''. Most apples that people grow are of the ''Malus domestica'' species.

Most apples are good to eat [[raw]] (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of [[bake]]d foods, such as [[apple pie]]. Apples are cooked until they are [[wikt:soft|soft]] to make [[apple sauce]].

Apples are also made into the [[drink]]s [[apple juice]] and [[cider]]. Usually, cider contains a little [[alcohol]], about as much as [[beer]]. The regions of [[Brittany]] in [[France]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] are known for their apple ciders.

== Apple cultivars ==
If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have [[DNA]] from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also  have DNA from the apple flower that [[pollinate]]d the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grow a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown [[stump]] called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed.

There are more than 7,500 known [[cultivar]]s of apples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elzebroek&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzebroek|first=A.T.G.|coauthors=Wind, K.|title=Guide to Cultivated Plants|publisher=CAB International|location=Wallingford|date=2008|page=27|isbn=1845933567|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvU1XnUVxFQC&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=apple%20cultivars%207%2C500&amp;pg=PT39#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different cultivars are available for [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] climates.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in [[England]]. Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh (dessert apples). However, some are grown simply for cooking or making [[cider]]. Cider apples are usually too [[wikt:tart|tart]] to eat immediately. However, they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.&lt;ref name=&quot;apples1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]] there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple.

Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organizations such as [http://www.commonground.org.uk/ Common Ground] teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. '[[Apple Day]]' is celebrated each [[October 21]] in many countries.

== In North America ==
Many apples are grown in [[temperate]] parts of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In many areas where apple growing is important, people have huge celebrations:

* [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival]] - held five days every spring (May-June) in [[Nova Scotia]]
* [[Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival]] - held six days every spring in [[Winchester, Virginia]].
* [[Washington State Apple Blossom Festival]] - held two weeks every spring (April-May) in [[Wenatchee, Washington]]

== Varieties of apples ==
[[File:Golden delicious apple.jpg|right|thumb|A Golden Delicious apple.]]
There are lots of different varieties of apples, including:

* [[Fuji (apple)]]
* [[Gala]]
* [[Golden Delicious]] (sometimes called a Green Delicious Apple)
* [[Granny Smith]]
* [[Jonagold]]
* [[McIntosh]]
* [[Pink Lady]]
* [[Red Delicious]]
* [[Winesap]]
* [[Cox's Orange Pippin]]

== Family ==
Apples are in the group [[Maloideae]]. It is a subfamily of the family ''[[Rosaceae]]''. They are in the same subfamily as [[pear]]s. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family.

An '''Abrahamic religion''' is a [[religion]] whose followers believe in prophet [[Abraham]] and his descendants to hold an important role in human spiritual development. The best known Abrahamic religions are [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Smaller religious traditions sometimes included as Abrahamic religions are [[Samaritanism]], [[Druze]], [[Rastafari]], [[Yazidi]], [[Babism]], [[Bahá'í Faith]]. [[Mandaeism]] is also sometimes included as an Abrahamic religion, but this actually inaccurate as Mandaeans believe that Abraham was a false prophet.

True Abrahamic religions are [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. They also all believe that people should [[pray]] to and [[worship]] God often. Of monotheistic religions, the Abrahamic religions have the world's largest number of followers. They are also all ethical monotheistic religions meaning they have a certain set of rules that they have to follow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Algebra is a part of [[mathematics]] (often called '''math''' in the United States and '''maths''' or numeracy in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math or Maths|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html|publisher=Wolfram.com|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). It uses [[variable]]s to represent a value that is not yet known.  When an equals sign (=) is used, this is called an [[equation]].  A very simple equation using a variable is: &lt;tt&gt;2 + 3 = x&lt;/tt&gt;   In this example, &lt;tt&gt;x = 5&lt;/tt&gt;, or it could also be said, &quot;x equals five&quot;.  This is called ''solving for x''.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algebra Introduction|url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction.html|publisher=Math Is Fun|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides equations, there are [[inequality|inequalities]] (''less than'' and ''greater than''). A special type of equation is called the function.  This is often used in making [[graph]]s.

Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things.  [[Physics]], [[engineering]] and [[computer programming]] are areas that use algebra all the time.  It is also useful to know in [[surveying]], [[construction]] and [[business]], especially [[accounting]].

People who do algebra need to know the rules of [[number]]s and mathematic [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] used on numbers, starting with [[addition|adding]], [[subtraction|subtracting]], [[multiplication|multiplying]], and [[division (mathematics)|dividing]].  More advanced operations involve [[exponent]]s, starting with [[square (algebra)|squares]] and [[square root]]s. Interestingly, many of these rules can also be used on the variables.

Algebra was first used to solve [[algebraic equation|equations]] and inequalities. Two examples are [[linear equation]]s (the equation of a line, &lt;tt&gt;y=mx+b&lt;/tt&gt;) and [[quadratic equation]]s, which has variables that are squared (power of two, a number that is multiplied by itself, for example: &lt;tt&gt;2*2, 3*3, x*x&lt;/tt&gt;).  How to [[factorization|factor]] [[polynomial]]s is needed for quadratic equations.

== History ==
Early forms of algebra were developed by the [[Babylonian]]s and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However the word &quot;algebra&quot; is a [[Latin language|Latin]] form of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Al-Jabr'' (&quot;casting&quot;) and comes from a mathematics book ''Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah'', (&quot;Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation&quot;) written in the [[9th century]] by a [[Iran|Persian]] mathematician, [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], who was a [[Islam|Muslim]] born in [[Khwarizm]] in [[Uzbekistan]]. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into [[Europe]] and [[translation|translated]] into Latin in the [[12th century]]. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'. (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word ''[[algorithm]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Algebra|url=http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~sxw8045/history.htm|publisher=UCS Louisiana|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Here is a simple example of an algebra problem:

:Sue has 12 candies, Ann has 24 
:candies. They decide to share so that they have the same number of candies. 

These are the steps you can use to solve the problem:

# To have the same number of candies, Ann has to give some to Sue.  Let ''x'' represent the number of candies Ann gives to Sue. 
# Sue's candies, plus ''x'', must be the same as Ann's candies minus ''x''.  This is written as: &lt;tt&gt;12 + x = 24 - x&lt;/tt&gt; 
# Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives: &lt;tt&gt;x = 12 - x&lt;/tt&gt;.  (What happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too, for the equation to still be true. So in this case when 12 was subtracted from both sides, there was a middle step of &lt;tt&gt;12 + x - 12 = 24 - x - 12&lt;/tt&gt;.  After a person is comfortable with this, the middle step is not written down.)
# Add ''x'' to both sides of the equation. This gives: &lt;tt&gt;2x = 12&lt;/tt&gt;
# Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives &lt;tt&gt;x = 6&lt;/tt&gt;. The answer is six.  If Ann gives Sue 6 candies, they will have the same number of candies.
# To check this, put 6 back into the original equation wherever ''x'' was: &lt;tt&gt;12 + 6 = 24 - 6&lt;/tt&gt;
# This gives &lt;tt&gt;18=18&lt;/tt&gt;, which is true.  They both now have 18 candies.

With practice, algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra.

== Writing algebra ==
As in most parts of mathematics, adding ''z'' to ''y'' (or ''y'' plus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y + z&lt;/tt&gt;.
Subtracting ''z'' from ''y'' (or ''y'' minus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y − z&lt;/tt&gt;.
Dividing ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' over ''z'': &lt;math&gt;y \over z&lt;/math&gt;) is written as &lt;tt&gt;y ÷ z&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt; is more commonly used.

In algebra, multiplying ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' times ''z'') can be written in 4 ways: &lt;tt&gt;y × z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y * z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y·z&lt;/tt&gt;, or just &lt;tt&gt;yz&lt;/tt&gt;. The multiplication symbol &quot;×&quot; is usually not used, because it looks too much like the letter x, which is often used as a variable.  Also, when multiplying a larger expression, parentheses can be used: &lt;tt&gt;y (z+1)&lt;/tt&gt;.

When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra, we write the number in front of the letter: &lt;tt&gt;5 × y = 5y&lt;/tt&gt;. When the number is 1, then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1 × ''y'' = ''y'') and so it is not needed.

== Functions and Graphs ==
[[File:Linear equation for y=3x+1.png|thumb|Linear equation for y=3x+1]]
An important part of algebra is the study of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve. A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out. When using functions, [[graph]]s can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations. 

A graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true. Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables. The graph is often a line, and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula &lt;tt&gt;y = mx + b&lt;/tt&gt;. The variable ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the graph (where the line crosses the vertical axis) and ''m'' is the [[mathematics|slope]] or steepness of the line. This formula applies to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] of a graph, where each point on the line is written &lt;tt&gt;(x, y)&lt;/tt&gt;.  

In some math problems like the equation for a line, there can be more than one variable (''x'' and ''y'' in this case).  To find points on the line, one variable is changed. The variable that is changed is called the &quot;independent&quot; variable.  Then the math is done to make a number. The number that is made is called the &quot;dependent&quot; variable. Most of the time the independent variable is written as ''x'' and the dependent variable is written as ''y'', for example, in &lt;tt&gt;y = 3x + 1&lt;/tt&gt;.  This is often put on a graph, using an ''x'' axis (going left and right) and a ''y'' axis (going up and down).  It can also be written in function form: &lt;tt&gt;f(x) = 3x + 1&lt;/tt&gt;.  So in this example, we could put in 5 for ''x'' and get &lt;tt&gt;y = 16&lt;/tt&gt;.  Put in 2 for ''x'' would get &lt;tt&gt;y=7&lt;/tt&gt;.  And 0 for ''x'' would get &lt;tt&gt;y=1&lt;/tt&gt;.  So there would be a line going thru the points (5,16), (2,7), and (0,1) as seen in the graph to the right.

If x has a power of 1, it is a straight line.  If it is squared or some other power, it will be curved.  If it uses an inequality (''&lt;'' or ''&gt;''), then usually part of the graph is shaded, either above or below the line.

== Rules of algebra ==
In algebra, there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations. These are called the rules of algebra. While these rules may seem senseless or obvious, it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics. Therefore, it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared, before taking them for granted. Before going on to the rules, reflect on two definitions that will be given.
# Opposite - the opposite of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt;.
# Reciprocal - the reciprocal of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Rules ===

==== Commutative property of addition ====
'Commutative' means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around. In other words, the order of the terms in an equation do not matter. When the operator of two terms is an addition, the 'commutative property of addition' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives &lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this does not apply for subtraction! (i.e. &lt;math&gt;a - b \ne b - a&lt;/math&gt;)

==== Commutative property of multiplication ====
When the operator of two terms is an multiplication, the 'commutative property of multiplication' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b = b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this does not apply for division! (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \ne \frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;a \neq b &lt;/math&gt;)

==== Associative property of addition ====
'Associative' refers to the grouping of numbers. The associative property of addition implies that, when adding three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives &lt;math&gt;a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this does not hold for subtraction, e.g. &lt;math&gt;1 = 0 - (0 - 1) \neq (0 - 0) - 1 = -1&lt;/math&gt; (see the distributive property).

==== Associative property of multiplication ====
The associative property of multiplication implies that, when multiplying three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this does not hold for division, e.g. &lt;math&gt;2 = 1/(1/2) \neq (1/1)/2 = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Distributive property ====
The distributive property states that the multiplication of a number by another term can be distributed. For instance: &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c) = ab + ac&lt;/math&gt;. (Do ''not ''confuse this with the associative properties! For instance, &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c) \ne (a \cdot b) + c&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Additive identity property ====
'Identity' refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself. In other words, there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum. The additive identity property states that the sum of any number and 0 is that number: &lt;math&gt;a + 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;. This also holds for subtraction: &lt;math&gt;a - 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Multiplicative identity property ====
The multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and 1 is that number: &lt;math&gt;a \cdot 1 = a&lt;/math&gt;. This also holds for division: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{1} = a&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Additive inverse property ====
The additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property. When an operation is the sum of a number and its opposite, and it equals 0, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: &lt;math&gt;a - a = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Additive inverse of 1 is (-1).

==== Multiplicative inverse property ====
The multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of a number and its reciprocal, and it equals 1, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{a} = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplicative inverse of 2 is 1/2.

==Advanced Algebra==
In addition to &quot;[[elementary algebra]]&quot;, or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as [[abstract algebra]], [[linear algebra]], and [[universal algebra]]. 
This includes how to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to solve many linear equations at once. ''[[Abstract algebra]]'' is the study of things that are found in equations, going beyond numbers to the more abstract with groups of numbers.

Many math problems are about physics and engineering. In many of these physics problems time is a variable. Time uses the letter ''t''. Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Energy is ''e'', force is ''f'', mass is ''m'', acceleration is ''a'' and speed of light is sometimes ''c''.  This is used in some famous equations, like &lt;tt&gt;f = ma&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;e=mc^2&lt;/tt&gt; (although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation).

An '''atom''' is the basic unit that makes up all [[matter]]. There are many different types of atoms, each with its own name, [[mass]] and size. These different atoms are called [[chemical element]]s. The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table. Examples of elements are [[hydrogen]] and [[gold]]. 

Atoms are very small, but the exact size changes depending on the element. Atoms range from 0.1 to 0.5 [[nanometer]]s in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/MichaelPhillip.shtml|title=Size of an Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt; One nanometer is about 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human [[hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml|title=Diameter of a Human Hair}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools. [[Equation]]s must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms.

Atoms join together to make [[molecule]]s: for example, two hydrogen atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom combine to make a [[water]] molecule. When atoms join together it is called a [[chemical]] reaction.

Every atom is made up of three kinds of smaller particles, called [[proton]]s (which are positively charged), [[neutron]]s (which have no charge) and [[electron]]s (which are negatively charged). The protons and neutrons are heavier, and stay in the middle of the atom. They are called the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. They are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are very light in weight and are attracted to the  positive charge of the nucleus.  This attraction is called [[electromagnetic]] force.

The number of protons, neutrons and electrons an atom has tells us what element it is. Hydrogen, for example, has one proton, no neutrons and one electron;  the element [[sulfur]] has 16 protons, 16 neutrons and 16 electrons. The number of protons is the atomic number. The number of protons and neutrons together is the [[Relative atomic mass|atomic weight]].

Atoms move faster when they are in gas form (because they are free to move) than they do in liquid form and solid matter. In solid [[material]]s, the atoms are tightly packed next to each other so they [[vibration|vibrate]], but are not able to move (there is no room) as atoms in liquids do.

== History ==
The word &quot;atom&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] (ἀτόμος) &quot;atomos&quot;, ''[[wiktionary:indivisible|indivisible]]'', from (ἀ)-, ''not,'' and τόμος, ''a cut.'' The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek [[philosophy|philosopher]] Democritus, around 400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.winneconne.k12.wi.us/ms_teachers/LENZ/history_of_atomic_theory.htm|title=History of Atomic Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic theory stayed as a mostly [[philosophy|philosophical]] subject, with not much actual scientific investigation or study, until the development of [[chemistry]] in the 1650s.

In 1777 [[France|French]] chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] defined the term ''element'' for the first time. He said that an [[chemical element|element]] was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry. Any substance that could be broken down was a ''[[Chemical compound|compound]]''.&lt;ref name=Brief&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.cerritos.edu/ladkins/a106/a%20brief%20history%20of%20the%20atom.htm|title=A Brief History of the Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[England|English]] philosopher [[John Dalton]] suggested that elements were tiny, solid balls made of atoms. Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. According to Dalton, in a certain compound, the atoms of the compound's elements always combine the same way.

In 1827, British scientist [[Robert Brown]] looked at [[pollen]] grains in water under his microscope. The pollen grains appeared to be jiggling. Brown used Dalton's atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved. This was called ''[[brownian motion]]''. In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were caused by the reactions of atoms, and by doing this he conclusively proved the existence of the atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_95/journal/vol4/ykl/report.html|title=Brownian motion - a history}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1869 scientist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published the first version of the [[periodic table]]. The periodic table groups elements by their [[atomic number]] (how many [[proton]]s they have. This is usually the same as the number of [[electron]]s). 
Elements in the same column, or period, usually have similar properties. For example, [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are all in the same column and have very similar properties. All these elements are [[gas]]es that have no colour and no smell. Also, they are unable to combine with other atoms to form compounds. Together they are known as the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;

{{anchor|Rutherford}}The physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] was the first person to discover electrons. This happened while he was working with [[cathode ray]]s in 1897. He realized they had a negative [[electric charge|charge]], unlike protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge). Thomson created the [[plum pudding model]], which stated that an atom was like plum pudding: the dried fruit (electrons) were stuck in a mass of pudding (protons). In 1909, a scientist named [[Ernest Rutherford]] used the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]] to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the [[atomic nucleus]]. Rutherford took a photo plate and covered it with gold foil, and then shot alpha particles (made of two protons and two neutrons stuck together) at it. Many of the particles went through the gold foil, which proved that atoms are mostly empty space. Electrons are so small they make up only 1% of an atom's [[mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ion.elte.hu/~akos/orak/atfsz/atom/rutherford_atom11.pdf|title=Ernest Rutherford on Nuclear spin and Alpha Particle interaction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ernest Rutherford LOC.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ernest Rutherford]]

In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] introduced the [[Bohr model]]. This model showed that electrons travel around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits. This was more accurate than the Rutherford model. However, it was still not completely right. Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced.

In 1925, chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/soddy-bio.html|title=Frederick Soddy, the Nobel Prize in chemistry: 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, any atom with 2 protons should be a [[helium]] atom. Usually, a helium [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] also contains two neutrons. However, some helium atoms have only one neutron. This means they truly are helium, because an element is defined by the number of protons, but they are not normal helium, either. Soddy called an atom like this, with a different number of neutrons, an ''[[isotope]]''. To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] and add this to the name of the element. So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium-3, and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon-12. However, when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed. To prove they were real, physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/chadwick-lecture.html|title=James Chadwick: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1935, a lecture on the Neutron and its properties}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms. By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom, neutrons must exist.

In 1937, [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Otto Hahn]] became the first person to create [[nuclear fission]] in a laboratory. He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a [[uranium]] atom, hoping to create a new isotope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/atomic/hahn-meitner.html|title=Otto Hahn, Liese Meitner and Fritz Strassman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a [[barium]] atom, a smaller atom than uranium. Apparently, Hahn had &quot;broken&quot; the uranium atom. This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction. This discovery eventually led to the creation of the [[atomic bomb]].

Further into the 20th century, physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom. Using [[particle accelerator]]s they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles, called [[quarks]].

The most accurate model so far comes from the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus, called the [[electron cloud]]. In the electron cloud, it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are. The Schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be. This area is called the electron's [[atomic orbital|orbital]].

== Structure and parts ==
=== Parts ===
[[File:Helium_atom_QM_DE.svg|thumb|A [[helium]] atom, with the nucleus shown in red (and enlarged), embeded in a cloud of electrons. ]]
The complex atom is made up of three main particles; the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]]. The [[isotope]] of [[Hydrogen]] Hydrogen-1 has no neutrons, just the one proton and one electron. A positive hydrogen [[ion]] has no electrons, just the one proton and one neutron. These two examples are the only known exceptions to the rule that all other atoms have at least one proton, one neutron and one electron each.

Electrons are by far the smallest of the three atomic particles, their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology.&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://sciencepark.etacude.com/particle/structure.php|title=Particle Physics - Structure of a Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a negative [[Electric charge|charge]]. Protons and neutrons are of similar size and weight to each other,&lt;ref name=park/&gt; protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge. 
Most atoms have a neutral charge; because the number of protons (positive) and electrons (negative) are the same, the charges balance out to zero. However, in [[ion]]s (different number of electrons) this is not always the case, and they can have a positive or a negative charge. Protons and neutrons are made out of [[quark]]s, of two types; up quarks and down quarks. A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark.

=== Nucleus ===
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom. It is made up of protons and neutrons. Usually in nature, two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other. So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together. They solved this by finding a particle called a ''[[gluon]]''. Its name comes from the word ''[[glue]]'' as gluons act like atomic glue, sticking the protons together using the ''strong nuclear force''. It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons.

[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|thumb|left|250px|A diagram showing the main difficulty in [[nuclear fusion]], the fact that protons, which have positive charges, repel each other when forced together.]]

The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through [[radioactive decay]]. When there are too many neutrons or protons, the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles. It does this by emitting radiation in the form of [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] or [[gamma ray|gamma]] decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/quantskills/methods/quantlit/RadDecay.html|title=How does radioactive decay work?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclei can change through other means too. [[Nuclear fission]] is when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of stored [[energy]]. This release of energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making [[bomb]]s and [[electricity]], in the form of [[nuclear power]]. 
The other way nuclei can change is through [[nuclear fusion]], when two nuclei join together, or fuse, to make a heavier nucleus. This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, as they have the same charge. Such high energies are most common in [[star]]s like our [[Sun]], which fuses hydrogen for fuel.

=== Electrons ===
{{main|Electron}}

Electrons  orbit, or travel around, the nucleus. They are called the atom's ''electron cloud''. They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]. Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge, so they attract each other. 
Around the nucleus, some electrons are further out than others, in different layers. These are called ''electron shells''. In most atoms the first shell has two electrons, and all after that have eight. Exceptions are rare, but they do happen and are difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemtutor.com/struct.htm#str|title=Chemtutor on atomic structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; The further away the electron is from the nucleus, the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it. This is why bigger atoms, with more electrons, react more easily with other atoms.
The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not strong enough to hold onto their electrons and atoms lose electrons to the strong attraction of smaller atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencebyjones.com/chemical_reactivity.htm|title=Chemical reactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radioactive decay ==
{{main|Radioactive decay}}

Some elements, and many isotopes, have what is called an ''unstable nucleus''. This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together&lt;ref name=Splung&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.splung.com/content/sid/5/page/radioactivity|title=Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; or has too many protons or neutrons. When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles. It does this through [[radiation]]. An atom that does this can be called ''radioactive''. Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass/particles that they become stable. All atoms above atomic number 82 (82 protons, lead) are radioactive.&lt;ref name=Splung /&gt;

There are three main types of radioactive decay; [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/gcse/physics/radioactivity/types-of-radiation.html|title=S-Cool: Types of radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alpha decay]] is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons. This is essentially a [[helium]] nucleus. The result is an element with atomic number two less than before. So for example if a [[beryllium]] atom (atomic number 4) went through alpha decay it would become helium (atomic number 2). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass.
* [[Beta decay]] is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case the atom shoots out an electron. In the second case it is a [[positron]] (like an electron but with a positive charge). The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons, or too many neutrons.
* [[Gamma ray|Gamma decay]] is when an atom shoots out a [[gamma ray]], or wave.  It happens when there is a change in the [[energy]] of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the mass, or atomic number or the atom, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus.

Every radioactive element or isotope has what is named a ''[[half-life (element)|half-life]]''. This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html|title=What is half-life?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large atoms, or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life, because they must lose more neutrons to become stable.

[[Marie Curie]] discovered the first form of radiation. She found the element and named it radium. She was also the first female recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]].

Frederick Soddy conducted an experiment to observe what happens as radium decays. He placed a sample in a light bulb and waited for it to decay. Suddenly, helium (containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons) appeared in the bulb, and from this experiment he discovered this type of radiation has a positive charge.

James Chadwick discovered the neutron, by observing decay products of different types of radioactive isotopes. Chadwick noticed that the atomic number of the elements was lower than the total atomic mass of the atom. He concluded that electrons could not be the cause of the extra mass because they barely have mass.

[[Enrico Fermi]], used the neutrons to shoot them at uranium. He discovered that uranium decayed a lot faster than usual and produced a lot of alpha and beta particles. He also believed that uranium got changed into a new element he named [[hesperium]].

[[Otto Hanh]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] repeated Fermi's experiment to see if the new element hesperium was actually created. They discovered two new things Fermi did not observe. By using a lot of neutrons the nucleus of the atom would split, producing a lot of heat energy. Also the fission products of [[uranium]] were already discovered: [[thorium]], [[palladium]], [[radium]], [[radon]] and [[lead]].

Fermi then noticed that the fission of one uranium atom shot off more neutrons, which then split other atoms, creating chain reactions. He realised that this process is called nuclear fission and could create huge amounts of heat energy.

That very discovery of Fermi's led to the development of the first nuclear bomb code-named 'Trinity'.

'''Astronomy''' is a [[natural science]]. It is the study of everything outside the [[atmosphere of Earth]].

It studies [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] (such as [[star]]s, [[Galaxy|galaxies]], [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moon]]s,  [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s and [[nebula]]e) and processes (such as [[supernova|supernovae explosions]], [[gamma ray burst]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]). This includes the [[physics]], [[chemistry]] of those objects and processes.

The word astronomy comes from the Greek words ''astron'' which means [[star]] and ''nomos'' which means [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astronomy
 |title=Astronomy - and etymology
 |accessdate=2008-11-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who studies astronomy is called an '''astronomer'''.

Astronomy is one of the oldest [[science]]s. Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant [[crops]]. Astronomy is very similar to [[astrophysics]]. A related subject, [[physical cosmology]], is concerned with studying the [[Universe]] as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System - Introduction|date=2001|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the way the universe changed over time. Astronomy is not the same as ''[[astrology]]'', the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect [[human]] lives.

Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy, ''observational'' and ''theoretical'' astronomy. Observational astronomy uses [[telescope]]s and [[camera]]s to ''[[wikt:observe|observe]]'' or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses [[maths]] and [[computer model]]s to predict what should happen. The two often work together, the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works.

== History of astronomy ==
{{main|History of astronomy}}
=== Ancient ===
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They used [[map]]s of the [[constellation]]s and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=17322&amp;pageno=5|title=An online book - Gutenberg history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early civilisations such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] people and the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built simple [[observatory|observatories]] and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of [[Earth]] in the [[universe]]. For a long time people thought [[Earth]] was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it.  This is known as [[geocentrism]].

[[Ancient Greeks]] tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, Otto E. 1975. ''A history of ancient mathematical astronomy''. Berlin: Springer. ISBN 978-0-387-06995-1&lt;/ref&gt; A mathematician named [[Eratosthenes]] was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a [[sphere]]. A theory by another mathematician named [[Aristarchus]] was, that the sun is in the center and the Earth is moving around it. This is known as [[heliocentrism]]. Only a few people thought it was right. The rest continued to believe in the ''geocentric'' model. Most of the names of constellations and stars come from Greeks of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston H. 1994 ''Early astronomy.'' Springer, p2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the [[Middle Ages]] including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1612/medieval.html|title=A brief history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also learned from the ancients by translating Greek books into Arabic.

=== Renaissance to modern era ===
[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawings of [[the Moon]] by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]. His drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the Moon.]]
During the [[renaissance]] a priest named [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of everything. Based on previous works, he said that the Earth was a [[planet]] and all the planets moved around the sun. This brought back the old idea of heliocentrism. A physicist called [[Galileo Galilei]] built his own [[telescope]]s, and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time. He agreed with Copernicus. The [[Catholic Church]] decided that Galileo was wrong. He had to spend the rest of his life under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/bio/narrative_7.html|title=Galileo Project - Galileo and the inquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heliocentric ideas were soon improved by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who invented the [[theory]] of [[gravity]]. 

After Galileo, people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e.

=== Modern era ===  
The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy.

In 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.

The opening of this new window on the [[Universe]] saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example [[pulsar]]s, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source.

The period after [[World War 2]] saw more [[observatory|observatories]] where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites, normally by governments. For example, [[Bernard Lovell]] began [[radio astronomy]] at Jodrell Bank using leftover military [[radar]] equipment. By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]], a good site for visible and [[infra-red]] telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.  

The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on [[satellite (artificial)|satellites]].

[[Space observatory|Space telescopes]] gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The [[X-ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] light and parts of the [[infra-red]] spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.

From 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

== Discoveries ==
Discoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.  Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way.  Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.  

=== Bodies ===
For convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.

==== Solar ====
* [[Planet]]s
* [[Asteroid]]s
* [[Comet]]s

==== Galactic ====
*[[Star]]s

Diffuse Objects:
* [[Nebula]]s
* Clusters

Compact Stars:
* [[White dwarf|White dwarves]]
* [[Neutron star]]s
* [[Black hole]]s

==== Cosmic ====
* [[Galaxy|Galaxies]]
* [[Galaxy cluster]]s
* [[Supercluster]]s

=== Phenomena ===
Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly.  These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a &quot;burst&quot; of energy.  They include: 
* [[Supernova]]s
* [[Nova]]s

Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way.  The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a [[Wave (physics)|wave]] to complete one cycle.  Periodic phenomena include: 
* [[Pulsar]]s
* [[Variable star]]s

Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago.  The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity.  In this way, it resembles &quot;noise&quot;, the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy.  The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions.  The principal astronomical example is: [[Cosmic background radiation]].

== Methods ==
=== Instruments ===
* [[Telescopes]] are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter. 
* [[Spectrometer]]s study the different [[wavelength]]s of light. This shows what something is made of. 
* Many telescopes are in satellites. They are [[space observatory|space observatories]].

=== Techniques ===
There are way  astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens.  Light from a distant source reaches a [[sensor]] and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera.  For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen.  One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using ''integration'' (which is like longer exposures in [[photography]]).

==== Integration ====
Astronomical sources do not move much: only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens. As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background, until it can be seen.  

Telescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures.  Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months. In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by [[computer]], which overlays the images after correcting for movement.

==== Aperture synthesis ====
With [[radio telescope]]s smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one, which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes.

==== Adaptive optics ====
[[Adaptive optics]] means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something, to see it better.

=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it. The observation is first stored as data.  This data will then have various techniques used to [[analysis|analyse]] it.

==== Fourier analysis ====
[[Fourier analysis]] in mathematics can show if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave).  If so, it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern, and find many things including new planets.

== Fields ==
A good example of a fields comes from [[pulsar]]s which pulse regularly in [[radio waves]].  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low-mass X-ray binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found. Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy, their period of importance and the terms used to describe them. It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum, although there is some evidence this is changing.

=== Fields by body ===
==== Solar astronomy ====
{{main|Sun}}

Solar astronomy is the study of the [[Sun]]. The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF1/142.html|title=Sun/Earth distance, article #144|accessdate=2009-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the easiest to observe in detail. Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged [[particle]]s called the [[Solar wind]] is constantly sent off from the Sun. The Solar Wind hitting the Earth's [[magnetic field]] causes the [[Aurora|northern lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Isun.html|title=The Solar Wind and the Van Allen radiation belts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the Sun helped people understand how [[nuclear fusion]] works.

==== Planetary astronomy ====
Planetary Astronomy is the study of [[planet]]s, [[Satellite (natural)|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own [[Solar System]] have been studied in depth by many visiting [[spacecraft]] such as [[Cassini-Huygens]] ([[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]) and the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]].

==== Galactic astronomy ====
Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant [[galaxy|galaxies]].  Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe.  Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations.

=== Fields by electromagnetic spectrum ===
==== Radio astronomy ====
*[[Radio telescope]]

==== Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) ====
Hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for [[mathematical model|mathematically modelling]] how gases behave. Strong [[magnetic field]]s found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave, affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars. This makes MHD an important and useful tool in astronomy.

=== Other fields ===
==== Gravitational wave astronomy ====
Gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the [[Universe]] in the gravitational wave spectrum.  So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  Gravitational Waves are ripples in [[spacetime]] emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include [[White dwarf|white dwarves]], [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s.  Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited.

A good example of a fields comes from [[pulsar]]s which pulse regularly in [[radio waves]].  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low-mass X-ray binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found. Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy, their period of importance and the terms used to describe them. It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum, although there is some evidence this is changing.

'''Architecture''' is the [[science]] of the [[design]] of [[structure]]s or [[building]]s such as houses, places of worship, and office buildings.  Architecture is also the [[profession]] of an [[architect]]. A person must [[wikt:study|study]] at an [[institution]] of [[higher education]] (university) to become an [[architect]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture can be about small designs, such as a [[garage]], or large designs, such as a whole [[city]]. Architecture often overlaps with [[civil engineering]], and architects and civil engineers often work together.

== History ==
[[File:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|thumb|Romanesque groin vault]]
In the past, people built [[wikt:hut|hut]]s and wood [[house]]s to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great [[civilization]]s like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built large [[temples]] and structures, like the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]]. The [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s made what we now call &quot;[[Classical Architecture]]&quot;. The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the [[arch]] from the [[Etruscans]], who copied it from the [[Mesopotamia]]ns. The [[stone]] [[column]]s, which still hold up so many important buildings, like the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], were simply copied from the first wooden posts.

[[File:Former post office in Nemti.jpg|thumb|A simpler building, in [[Hungary]]]]
'''Classical Architecture''' was very formal, and it always obeyed [[laws]]. It used [[symmetry]], which really means [[wikt:simple:balance|balance]], and it used [[proportion]] which means keeping shapes in certain ways. The [[Golden ratio|Golden Mean]] was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched [[bridge]] needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of [[year]]s of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.

In some parts of the world, like [[India]], the architecture is famous for [[carving]] the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in [[China]], [[Japan]], Southeast Asia, [[Africa]], [[Mexico]], and Central and [[South America]].

Later, people in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] made [[Romanesque architecture]], then [[Gothic architecture]].  Gothic buildings have tall, pointed [[window]]s and arches.  Many [[church]]es have Gothic architecture. [[Castle]]s were also built at this time. In [[Eastern Europe]], churches usually had [[dome]]s. People added their own ideas and [[decoration]] to the Classical Architecture of the past.  The [[Renaissance]] brought a return to classical ideas. 
[[File:NYC - Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Architecture can have many styles, such as the curved [[Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]]]]
In the late 18th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]], people began to [[invent]] machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many [[factory|factories]] and [[Mill (factory)|mills]] were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the [[Victorian era]], architects like [[George Fowler Jones]] and [[Decimus Burton]] still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and [[masonry]] used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with [[buttress]]es allowed stone buildings to be built taller.  For example, the cathedral in [[Ulm]], Germany is over 500 feet tall.  However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse.  This happened to the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], which was never completed. 
[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|thumb|New technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]]]]

Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, [[steel]] became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and [[reinforced concrete]] to build. An example is the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them [[skyscrapers]]. This new [[technology]] has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.

[[Modernism]] is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called &quot;post-modern&quot;.

Many of the world's greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], [[Edward Durell Stone]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Fazlur Khan]], [[Gottfried Böhm]], and [[Bruce Graham]].

'''Anatomy''' is the [[research|study]] of the [[body|bodies]] of living beings. This can be [[human|people]], [[animal]]s, or [[plant]]s. It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts ([[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[muscle]]s and [[bone]]s). People who study ''anatomy'' then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

==Body Systems==
There are different [[organ system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, such as the cardiovascular system, also known as the [[circulatory system]] (the system that gets [[blood]] around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains [[muscle]]s), the [[nervous system]] (the system that controls the [[nerve]]s,and the brain) and the [[skeleton]] (the bones).

Anatomy, [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are similar basic medical sciences.

An '''asteroid''' is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the [[Sun]]. It is like a [[planet]] but smaller. They range from less than 1 km (over 1000 feet) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have [[asteroid moon]]s.

The name &quot;asteroid&quot; means &quot;like a star&quot; in the ancient [[Greek language]]. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the [[Sun]], while stars only seem to move because the [[Earth]] spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own [[light]]. Because of this, some people think &quot;asteroids&quot; is not a good name, and think that the name &quot;planetoid&quot; (&quot;like a planet&quot;) would be a better name.

Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. It was named [[1 Ceres]], and is the biggest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. Other asteroids in the asteroid belt, like [[3 Juno|Juno]], [[2 Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta]] were found later. Today, astronomers using computerized [[telescope]]s find thousands of asteroids every month.  

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the [[Solar System]]. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide but  some are made of [[carbon]] or [[metal]]. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various kinds in including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).

Most asteroids in our [[Solar System]] are in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s. Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off [[K/T extinction event|all the dinosaurs]] and caused some of the other [[extinction event]]s.

==Climate==
Angola's average temperature on the coast is {{convert|16|C|F}} in the winter and {{convert|21|C|F}} in the summer. It has two seasons; dry (May to October) and hot rainy (November to April).

==Demographics==
[[File:Angola Map.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;Map of Angola&lt;/center&gt;]]
Angola's population is estimated to be 18,498,000 (2009).&lt;ref name=unpop/&gt;

==Provinces==
&lt;gallery&gt;

'''Argentina''' (officially the '''Argentine Republic''')  is a country in [[South America]]. Argentina is the second-largest [[country]] in [[South America]] and the eighth-largest country in the world.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the language most people speak and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. 
There are minorities speaking [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Quechua]] and even [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Patagonia]].

The [[capital (city)|capital city]] of the Argentina is [[Buenos Aires]], one of the largest cities in the world, in eastern Argentina. In order by number of people, the largest [[city|cities]] in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucumán]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Bahía Blanca]].

Argentina is between the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

== History ==
The name '''Argentina''' comes from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]) as the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s believed the area had [[silver]]. In the Americas, Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).

The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the [[Patagonia]] (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the [[Inca Empire]] conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the [[Guaraní]] developed a culture based on [[yuca]] and [[sweet potato]] however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.

Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.

Argentina declared independent from Spain in 1816, and achieved it in a War led by [[José de San Martín]] in 1818. Many immigrants from Europe came to the country. By the 1920s it was the 7th wealthiest country in the world, but it began a decline after this. In the 1940s, following the &quot;infamous decade&quot; where the country's politics were not stable, [[Juan Peron]] came to power. Peron was one of the most important people in the country's history and many politicians today call themselves Peronist. Peron was forced out of power in 1955. After spending years in exile he returned to power in the 1970s.

In 1976, the country was falling into chaos, and the military took power. This was not the first time the military had done this. Leading the new government was [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. Videla was one of history's most brutal dictators. Thousands of people disappeared or were killed during his time as president. Videla retired in 1980.

One of his successors was another general turned dictator, [[Leopoldo Galtieri]]. By the time Galtieri was in office in 1981 the dictatorship became unpopular. To try to stir up support, Galtieri ordered an invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]], starting a war. Argentina lost the war, and soon the country fell into chaos again. Galtieri was removed from power and eventually democracy was restored. Galtieri and Videla would be charged with &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; because of the mass murder and other crimes that they ordered as president.

Today, Argentina is one of the most important countries in Latin America, though it still has many problems facing it. It has a large economy and is an influential country in the &quot;southern cone&quot; of South America.

== Politics ==
Argentina is a [[federal republic]]. The people of Argentina vote for a [[President]] to rule them and [[Senator]]s and [[Deputy|Deputies]] to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is [[Mauricio Macri]] since December 2015.

== Administrative divisions ==
Argentina is divided into 23 [[province]]s (''provincias''; singular: ''provincia''), and 1 city (commonly known as ''capital federal''):

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}
[[File:Argentina - Político.png|260px|thumb|left|alt=Map of Argentina|Map of Argentina]]

Argentina is almost 3,700&amp;nbsp;km long from north to south, and 1,400&amp;nbsp;km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the [[Pampas]] in the central part of the country, [[Patagonia]] in the southern part down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point in the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. [[Cerro Aconcagua]], at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), is the [[Americas|Americas']] highest mountain.

The most important rivers include the [[Rio de la Plata|River Plate]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.

See [[List of cities in Argentina]] for the many places people live in Argentina.

== Other information ==
The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], other Europeans countries and [[Mestizo]] representing more than 90% of the total population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Football in Argentina|Football]] or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is [[Pato]]. Argentina has a number of highly ranked [[Polo]] players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites.

Argentina is a [[Christian]] country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are [[Roman Catholic]]. Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.

Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.

Austria is more than a thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the [[ninth century]]. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; is first written in an official document from [[996]]. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word ''Österreich,'' which literally means &quot;East Kingdom.&quot;

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age. That was the time of the [[Neanderthal]]s. They left works of art such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for [[mineral]] resources, especially [[copper]]. [[Ötzi the Iceman|Ötzi]], a [[mummy]] found in a [[glacier]] between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the [[Bronze Age]] people built bigger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were [[mineral]] resources. [[Salt mine|Salt mining]] began near [[Hallstatt]]. At that time, [[Celt]]s began to form the first states.

=== The Romans ===
[[File:Austria Romana.png|left|thumb|Map]]
====The Roman cities and their modern names====
The Romans came 15 B.C. to Austria and made the Celtic Regnum Noricum to a province. Modern Austria was part of three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia. The border in the north was the [[Danube]].

=== Modern times ===
Austria was the [[Austrian Empire]] from about 800 to 1867 and was ruled by The House of [[Habsburg]] for most of that period. Between 1867 and 1918 it was a part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Then it became a [[republic]]. The ''First Republic'' was from 1918 to 1938. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of [[Nazi Germany]]. The ''Second Republic'' was started in 1945.

The author identifies and compares the formal powers of the president, prime minister, and parliament under the 1995 Constitution as well as the amendments introduced through the Constitutional referendum in 2005. Markarov argues that the highly presidentialized semi-presidential system that was introduced in the early 1990s gradually evolved into a Constitutionally more balanced structure. However, in practice, the president has remained dominant and backed by a presidential majority; the president has thus been able to set the policy agenda and implement his preferred policy. |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armenia''' (officially called the '''Republic of Armenia''') is a country in the western part of Asia. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Yerevan]]. Armenia received its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1991]].

Armenia touches [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]].

There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Russia]]n, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic [[Armenians]].  Also, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], is by far the largest religion in the country. There is a small amount of other [[Christians]], [[Muslims]] and [[atheists]].

Armenia is the place that some Christians believe [[Noah's Ark]] landed, and Noah's family settled.  The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik.  Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]].

Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times.  Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BCE, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia.

From [[1920]] to [[1991]], Armenia was a member of the [[Soviet Union]].

Today, Armenia's borders are locked with [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]], due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.

== Geography ==
Armenia is [[landlocked country|landlocked]] in the [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasus]]. It is between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. The country is bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].

It covers an area of {{convert|29743|km2|sqmi|0}}. The land is mostly mountains, with fast flowing rivers and few forests. There are hot summers and cold winters. 

[[Mount Ararat]] used to be part of Armenia. It is the highest mountain in the region. It is now in Turkey, but clearly visible in Armenia. The Armenians see it as a [[symbol]] of their land. Because of this, the mountain is present on the [[Coat of arms of Armenia|Armenian national emblem]] today.

== Provinces ==
Armenia is divided into ten [[provinces]] and the capital city of [[Yerevan]].  As of 2007, Armenia includes 915 communities.  49 are considered [[urban]] and 866 are considered [[rural]].  For a list of communities see [[List of settlements in Armenia]].

'''Archaeology''', or '''archeology''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Society for American Archaeology&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.saa.org/ForthePublic/Resources/OtherUsefulResources/Whyaretheretwodifferentspellingsarchaeology/tabid/1078/Default.aspx |title=Society for American Archaeology |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of the [[past]] by looking for the remains and artifacts ([[history|historical things]]) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old [[coin]]s, [[tool]]s, [[building]]s, and inscriptions.  Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.

Archaeologists are like [[historian]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.  They think it is important to understand the past.

== Fieldwork ==
When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a [[university]] or [[museum]]. They record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As [[Human settlement|settlements]] (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient [[Rome]], for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.

==Fields of interest==
[[Archaeologist]]s do not all study the same [[civilization]]s, they specialize in different areas of interest. Some fields of interest include [[Ancient Egypt]] (these specialists are called [[Egyptologist]]s), [[Ancient China]], or the [[Vikings]]. Archaeologists study every [[civilization]] that is known, especially the ones where there is no written [[history]]. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the [[human evolution|beginning of human life]] in Africa, or study [[World War II]]. Marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for [[shipwreck|sunken ships]] or [[city|cities]] that have been lost under the sea.

==Sites==
[[Stonehenge]], in [[England]], is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include the [[Roman Forum]], [[Angkor Wat]], [[Machu Picchu]], and [[Great Zimbabwe]]. In many countries, [[government]]s and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.

Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new [[building]]s. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people who are building often don't have a lot of time. Many times as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are very important.

*In [[medicine]], 'application' means putting some [[drug]] or [[ointment]] usually on the [[skin]] where it is absorbed into the [[human body]].

*In [[computer software]], an application is a type of [[computer program|program]] which is designed for a particular [[wikt:simple:function|function]]. Example: [[word processing]].
 
*In [[business]] or [[government]], an application is a (usually [[paper]]) [[form]] filled out and handed in by a person seeking a [[wikt:privilege|privilege]] from a [[state]] or [[company]], such as [[Employment|work]], [[credit]], some type of [[license]] or [[permit]], or a [[house|place to live]].

*At work, generally [[engineering]], when dealing with certain [[material]]s or [[wikt:object|objects]], an &quot;application&quot; is a [[wikt:purpose|purpose]] that material or object can be used for. [[Wood]] and [[steel]] have many applications.

'''Animals''' are [[eukaryotic]] organisms with [[Multicellular organism|many cells]]. They do not use [[light]] to get [[energy]] as [[plants]] do. The study of animals is called [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Ville C.A; Walker W.F. &amp; Barnes R.D. 1984. ''General zoology''. Saunders&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Gina. ''Kingdoms of life – Animals''. Lorenz Educational Press. ISBN 978-1-4291-1610-7&lt;/ref&gt; Animals use different ways to get energy from other living things. They usually eat other living things, but some are [[parasitism|parasites]] or have [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s as [[symbiosis|symbionts]].

Plants are also [[multicellular]] eukaryotic [[organism]]s, but most animals are [[motile|mobile]], meaning they can move around. Animals take in [[oxygen]], and give out [[carbon dioxide]]. This [[cellular respiration]] is part of their [[metabolism]] (chemical working). In both these ways they are different from [[plants]]. Also, the cells of animals have different [[cell membrane]]s to other [[eukaryotes]] like plants and [[fungi]].

==Grouping animals==
There are many types of animals. The common animals most [[people]] know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. When [[biologists]] look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a [[biological classification]]. They think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million.

Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups: the [[invertebrate]]s and the [[vertebrate]]s. Vertebrates have a [[backbone]], or [[spine]]; invertebrates do not.

Vertebrates are:
*[[fish]] (or 'fishes': both ways are correct)
*[[amphibian]]s
*[[reptile]]s
*[[bird]]s
*[[mammal]]s

Some invertebrates are:
*[[insect]]s
*[[spider]]s
*[[crustacean]]s
*[[mollusc]]s (like a [[snail]] or [[squid]])
*[[worm]]s
*[[jellyfish]]

In scientific usage, humans are considered animals, in everyday nonscientific usage, humans are often not considered to be animals.

==Life styles==
The animal mode of [[nutrition]] is called [[heterotroph]]ic because they get their food from other living organisms. Some animals eat only plants; they are called [[herbivore]]s. Other animals eat only [[meat]] and are called [[carnivore]]s. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called [[omnivore]]s.

The [[environments]] animals live in vary greatly. By the process of [[evolution]], animals [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the [[habitats]] they live in. A [[fish]] is adapted to its life in water and a [[spider]] is adapted to a life catching and eating insects. A [[mammal]] living on the [[savannah]]s of [[East Africa]] lives quite a different life from a [[sea mammal]] (like a [[dolphin]] or [[porpoise]]) catching fish in the sea.

The [[fossil]] record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the [[Ediacaran]] period, or somewhat earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Possible animal-body fossils in pre-Marinoan limestones from South Australia |journal= Nature Geoscience | volume= 3 | pages= 653–659 |url= http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n9/full/ngeo934.html |doi=10.1038/ngeo934 | issue= 9|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..653M|last1= Maloof, Adam C. ''et al'' 2010}} [http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/maloof/papers_pub/24Maloof.pdf Pdf]. These fossils are interpreted as being early sponges. They were found in 665-million-year-old rock.&lt;/ref&gt; During the whole of this long time, animals have been constantly [[evolving]], so that the animals alive on [[Earth]] today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the Ediacaran. The study of ancient life is called [[palaeontology]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acceleration''' is a [[measure]] of how [[speed|fast]] [[velocity]] [[wikt:change|changes]]. Acceleration is the change of velocity [[Division (mathematics)|divide]]d by the change of [[time]]. Acceleration is a [[vector]], and therefore includes both a [[size]] and a [[direction]].
 
== Examples ==
* An object was moving [[north]] at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 [[meter]]s per [[second]]. The object has accelerated. 
* An [[apple]] is falling down. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.
* Jane is walking [[east]] at 3 [[kilometer]]s per [[hour]]. Jane's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is [[zero]]. 
* Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns and walks [[south]] at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a nonzero acceleration. 
* Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, Sally walks east at 1.5 kilometers per hour. Sally has had a nonzero acceleration.
* [[Acceleration due to gravity]]

== Finding acceleration ==

Acceleration is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of the [[velocity]] of an object. Acceleration &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{{a}}&lt;/math&gt; can be found by using:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{{a}} = {\mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0} \over { t_1 - t_0 }}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the start
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the end
:&lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the start 
:&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the end 

Sometimes the change in velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δ&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes the change in time &lt;math&gt;{ t_1 - t_0 }&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δt.

In difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using [[mathematics]]: in [[calculus]], acceleration is the [[Derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of the velocity (with respect to time), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Units of measurement ===
Acceleration has its own [[units of measurement]]. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared  (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

=== Other words ===
Acceleration can be [[positive]] or [[negative number|negative]]. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word &quot;acceleration&quot;.

== Newton's second law of motion ==
Newton's laws of motion are [[rule]]s for how things [[Movement|move]]. These rules are called &quot;[[law]]s of [[motion (physics)|motion]]&quot;. [[Isaac Newton]] is the [[scientist]] who first wrote down the main laws of motion.
According to [[Newton's laws of motion#Second Law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the [[Force (physics)|force]] something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's [[mass]] (the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; the object is made from or how &quot;heavy&quot; it is).
The formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the force, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass. 
This formula is very well-known, and it is very important in [[physics]]. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short &quot;Newton's Second Law&quot;, is often one of the first things that physics students learn.

== Deceleration ==
Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration. This means that something slows down instead of speeding up. For example, when a car brakes, it is decelerating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Black pudding''' is an English name for blood sausage.  It is [[food]] made by [[cooking]] down the [[blood]] of any [[mammal]] (usually [[pig]]s or cattle) with meat, fat or filler until it is thick enough to [[congealing|congeal]] (become firm or solid) when cooled.

==Types of Black pudding==
[[File:Blutwurst.jpg|thumb|German ''Blutwurst'']]
In [[Great Britain]], blood sausage is called  ''Black Pudding''. The ingredients include pig's blood, [[suet]], [[bread]], [[barley]] and [[oats|oatmeal]]. The most common kind of German ''blutwurst'' is made from fatty pork meat, beef blood and filler such as barley. Though already cooked and &quot;ready to eat&quot; it is usually served warm.

Other kinds of blood sausage include ''boudin noir'' (France), ''boudin rouge'' ([[Creole]] and [[Cajun]]) and ''morcilla'' (Spain).

==History==
A [[legend]] says that blood sausage was invented in a [[gambling|bet]] between two [[Bavarian]] [[butcher]]s drunk on the alcoholic drink [[absinthe]] during the [[14th century]]. [[Homer]]'s ''Odyssey'' from Ancient [[Greece]] says that &quot;As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted...&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''boot device''' is used to start a [[computer]].  It is named after a [[boot]] which fits on the [[foot]].  The word [[bootstrap]] is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. It comes from the English phrase &quot;pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.&quot;

Before a computer can operate normally, it must have [[operating system]] instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions.  A boot device loads the operating system into the [[memory]] of the computer. 

Devices that can boot a computer are usually '''boot disks''' or '''boot drives''' (normally a [[hard drive]], but can be a [[floppy disk]] or a [[compact disk|CD]]). Some [[Computer network|network computers]] use ''boot chips'' that get the [[operating system]] over a [[network]]. Web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the [[mobile phone]] network.  '''Boot card''' standards may let many users boot [[kiosk computer]]s with full [[privacy]] and access to all [[application software]] they own. There are also '''boot boards''' or '''boot ''add-in'' cards''' that are more permanent than boot cards.

Some people refer to the boot device as just a '''boot''' and non-boot devices as '''data device'''s, although it is not the [[computer]] but the [[operating system]] that cares about the difference between these.

==Origin==
The boot in '''boot device''' is the same as [[booting]] (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.

[[File:Boots-WhiteLeather-6cmHeel.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
A '''boot''' is a type of [[footwear]] that protects the [[foot]] and [[ankle]]. Boots are higher and larger than [[shoe]]s and [[sandal]]s. Some boots are high enough to protect the [[leg|calves]] (lower part of the leg) as well.  Some boots are held on with ''bootstraps'' or ''bootlaces''.  Some also have '''spats''' or ''gaiters'' to keep water out.  Most have a very strong ''boot sole'', the bottom part of a boot.

* '''Rain boots''' (or rubber boots) are made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. Rain boots protect a person's feet from [[water]] and [[rain]]. People who work on [[fishing]] boats and [[farmer]]s wear rubber boots to keep their feet dry. People who work in [[chemical industry|chemical]] factories wear rubber boots to protect their feet from dangerous chemicals.

* '''Winter boots''' are boots that keep a person's feet warm in cold weather. People in cold countries such as [[Canada]] and [[Sweden]] wear winter boots during the cold season. Winter boots can be made from many different materials, such as [[leather]], [[fabric]], or [[plastic]]. Winter boots are [[thermal insulation|insulated]] with wool or fur to keep the feet warm. Most winter boots also keep people's feet dry.

* '''Work boots''' (or &quot;[[construction]] boots&quot;) are designed for people who work in construction or [[factory]] jobs. Work boots often have a steel toe cover to protect the person's toes. Work boots are usually made of strong leather, to protect the person's foot from sharp objects or dangerous chemicals. Some work boots have a flat piece of [[steel]] in the sole to protect the foot from sharp [[nail]]s. Many countries require construction workers to wear work boots when they are on a construction site.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bankruptcy''' is a [[law|legal process]] which happens when a person or an organisation does not have enough [[money]] to pay all of its [[debt]]s.  Legally they are [[Insolvency|insolvent]].

Where it is a person who cannot pay their debts, the person's creditors may ask the court to appoint a ''trustee in bankruptcy''.   This is a professional accountant who is appointed by the court, and they will take control of the bankrupt person's assets.  Some assets are protected by law, but the trustee in bankruptcy will sell off all of the other assets and use the proceeds to pay as much of that person's debts as possible.  After the process is complete the person is ''discharged from bankruptcy'', and the person is free from any further liability to pay those claims, but normally that person will be limited in their ability to borrow money again because their credit rating will be damaged.

Where it is an organisation who cannot pay their debts, the creditors may ask the court to appoint a ''liquidator''.  The liquidator does a very similar job to the trustee in bankruptcy except that there are no assets which are protected so the liquidator can sell everything.  Once all of the assets of the organisation have been sold, the organisation is then ''dissolved'' and no longer exists.  Organisations do not get discharged from bankruptcy in the same way that a living person does.

== Insolvency or bankrupcy ==
People often confuse the terms '''bankruptcy''' and '''[[insolvency]]''', and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other.  Insolvency usually just means that a someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or (sometimes) that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets.  Bankruptcy is a formal legal process in front of the courts.  Although the two terms are connected, just because a person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy.

== Alternatives to bankruptcy ==
Many countries have alternatives to bankruptcy to try and allow people and businesses to try and avoid the bankruptcy process.

In various countries, individual people can try and reach ''individual voluntary arrangements'' (or IVAs) with their creditors.  This means that the creditors agree to take less money to discharge their debts.  There are similar processes for companies and other organisations, and they go by various different names in different countries, but in many countries they are called ''schemes of arrangement''.

== Bankruptcy protection ==
In many countries a [[company]] or [[business]] can ask the courts for ''bankruptcy protection'' to try and protect the business so that the [[creditor]]s cannot destroy all of the [[physical capital]] and [[goodwill]] by breaking it apart and moving it away. The aim of this is provide is more [[time]] for the business to reorganise itself and to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money.  In many countries this is called ''going into administration''.

However, not all countries have bankruptcy protection laws for businesses.

== Debt slavery ==
Often a [[creditor]] threatens a [[debtor]] with [[debt slavery]] in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name=NoackWP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/11/18/map-the-worlds-36-million-slaves/ |title=Map: The world’s 36 million slaves |author=Rick Noack |date=18 November 2014 |website= |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the debtor does not know that they have a right to go '''bankrupt'''. This is a [[human rights]] problem in some countries.&lt;ref name=NoackWP/&gt; Also, some creditors continue to harass a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not, hoping that the debtor will pay them money that they do not deserve.

== United States ==
Bankruptcy in the United States falls mostly under federal law, Title 11 of the [[United States]] [[Law|Code]] (Bankruptcy Code). The types of bankruptcy available in the United States are named after the primary divisions, or &quot;chapters&quot;, of that law. The person or business that files a bankruptcy case is known as the ''debtor''.

When a bankruptcy case is filed, a [[trustee]] is chosen by the court. The trustee has authority over the property of the bankrupt person or business and may use some of the debtor's [[asset]]s to pay the [[creditor]]s. After a bankruptcy is filed, creditors are notified that they are to stop trying to collect money directly from the debtor and are to make claims for payment to the bankruptcy court.

===Chapter 7===
The most common form of bankruptcy is the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, which can be filed by [[business]]es or individuals.&lt;ref name=NOLO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/chapter-7-13-bankruptcy-basics-29829.html |title=What Is Bankruptcy? |author= |date= |website= |publisher=NOLO |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called [[liquidation]] bankruptcy because some of a debtor's [[property]] may be sold (liquidated) to satisfy creditors.&lt;ref name=NOLO/&gt; 

When a [[business]] is in [[debt]] and cannot pay it, it may ask or be forced to file bankruptcy in court under Chapter 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|title=11 U.S. Code § 109 - Who may be a debtor|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chapter 7 usually makes a [[company]] stop doing business. [[Employee]]s often lose their jobs when company files for chapter 7.

===Chapter 11===
Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a complicated type of bankruptcy that reorganizes the debtor's finances, usually reducing the amount of debt owed and changing debt repayment terms. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy case allows a business to keep running while it finds ways to reduce and and arrange payment of its debts.

Almost all Chapter 11 bankruptcies are filed by businesses. Ordinary people do not usually file Chapter 11 bankruptcy, because a Chapter 13 bankruptcy will almost always be cheaper and easier for them.

===Chapter 13===
Chapter 13 is the most popular form of bankruptcy in the United States for ordinary people.&lt;ref name=NOLO/&gt; In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy some of your debts may be forgiven (discharged), but you will have to pay back a portion of your debt. The debt repayment plan is supervised by the bankruptcy court and usually lasts for three to five years. Businesses cannot file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

===Other bankruptcy chapters===

Less common forms of bankruptcy may be filed under Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.

====Chapter 9====
Chapter 9 bankruptcy allows [[Municipality|municipalities]], smaller units of government such as cities and towns, to restructure their debts.

====Chapter 12====
Chapter 12 bankruptcy is a special type of bankruptcy for family farms and fisherman. It combines elements of Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy to allow smaller farms and fishing businesses to stay open while they restructure their debts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breakfast sausage''' is a type of fresh [[pork]] [[sausage]] made from [[season]]ed [[ground]] [[meat]] mixed with [[bread]] crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as Polish or Italian-style sausages.

==Using breakfast sausages==
Breakfast sausages are not [[curing|cured]] or [[smoking|smoked]] like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen).  Uncooked sausages should be stored in the [[refrigerator]] or the [[Refrigerator|freezer]]. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot [[soap]]y water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. 

They are usually [[Frying|fried]] or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at [[breakfast]], often with cooked [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[pancake]]s, and [[toast]]ed bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as &quot;toad in the hole&quot; a cooked batter dish.

==Types of breakfast sausages==
Different types made from pork and [[beef]] mixtures as well as [[poultry]] can now be found. There are also [[vegetarian]] types that use [[tofu|textured vegetable protein]] in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.

A '''browser''' is an animal, usually a [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]], which eats [[leaves]] and [[shrub]]s rather than [[grass]]. It is contrasted with [[grazer]]s, which eat grass.

'''Beekeeping''' or '''apiculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[honeybee]]s.

== Uses ==
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for [[honey]]. That is becoming less true. Instead, it is more used for [[crop]] [[pollination]] and other products. These are [[:wikt:wax|wax]] and [[propolis]].

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest. She lays all the eggs, which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons. However, they do not control the hive.

== Types of beekeeping ==
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a [[hobby]]. Urban beekeeping is a growing trend, and some have found that &quot;city bees&quot; are actually healthier than &quot;rural bees&quot; because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/23/can-cities-save-bees&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
[[Colony Collapse Disorder]] is a growing problem, along with [[mite]]s.

      <comment>/* Vocabulary in British English */ Removed &quot;* shifting – moving&quot; as again used both in the UK and US</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''British English''' is the kind of [[English language]] which is used in the [[United Kingdom]] and in most countries which previously were in the [[British Empire]].

== Pronunciation in British English ==
In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example, a man from a place near [[London]] may not pronounce his &quot;r&quot;s the same as a man from [[Scotland]] or a man from [[Northern Ireland]]. Across the country, the accent is different. For instance, in [[Liverpool]], one speaks with a &quot;scouse&quot; accent, and in [[London]], one speaks with a &quot;cockney&quot; accent. Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt. One place people speak English in a different way is [[Cornwall]], where the [[Cornish dialect]] is spoken. 

=== Other languages ===
Britain, like other countries, has languages other than English. In [[Wales]] many speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]]; in [[Scotland]] some people speak [[Gaelic]], and in [[Ireland]] a few people speak [[Irish language|Irish]]. However, that is not the subject of this particular article.

== Spelling in British English ==
British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. 

* Some British English words end in &quot;re&quot;, because the words were originally taken from [[French language|French]].  They are often simplified to &quot;er&quot; in American English
::British English: centre, litre, metre.
::American English: center, liter, meter.
* Some British English words end in &quot;our&quot; and are simplified to &quot;or&quot; in American English. The English spelling also came from the French language.
::British English: colour, favour, honour, labour
::American English: color, favor, honor, labor
* Some British English words the have come originally from the Greek language use &quot;ph&quot;. This has been changed to &quot;f&quot; in some other languages.
::British English: Sulphur
:: American English: Sulfur
* Some words in British English use &quot;s&quot; where &quot;z&quot; is used in American English. However, spelling them with &quot;z&quot; is also done in Britain sometimes.
::British English: colonisation, realisation, organisation
::American English: colonization, realization, organization
* The word &quot;[[gray]]&quot; is also a special case, as it is normally spelled &quot;gray&quot; in American English and &quot;grey&quot; in British English. However, &quot;gray&quot; is also used in Britain, and &quot;grey&quot; is also used in America.
* Many of these rules are also used in other countries outside of the [[United Kingdom]], mostly in countries that are members in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== Vocabulary in British English ==
In British English, &quot;dock&quot; refers to the [[water]] in the space between two &quot;piers&quot; or &quot;wharfs&quot;. In American English, the &quot;pier&quot; or &quot;wharf&quot; could be called a &quot;dock&quot;, and the water between would be a &quot;slip&quot;.

Some common differences:

British – American
* accelerator – throttle
* [[autumn]] – fall
* [[biscuit]] – cookie
* bonnet – hood (of a car)
* [[boot]] – trunk (of a car)
* bum – butt
* caravan – trailer, mobile home
* chips – [[French fries]]
* courgette – [[zucchini]]
* crisps – chips
* face flannel – washcloth
* flat – apartment
* [[football (soccer)|football]] – soccer
* garden – yard
* handbag – purse
* jumper – sweater
* [[lift]] – elevator
* lorry – truck
* manual gearbox – stick shift
* metro, underground, tube – subway
* motorway – freeway
* mum – mom
* nappy – diaper
* number plate – license plate
* pants - underpants
* pavement – sidewalk
* pram – stroller
* petrol – gas or gasoline
* phone box - phone booth
* post – mail, mailbox
* [[railway]] – railroad
* shopping trolley – shopping cart
* take-away – take-out
* trousers – pants
* torch – flashlight
* tram – streetcar

== Usage in different countries ==
[[American English]] is only an official language in the [[United States]]. In [[Canada]], the accent sounds extremely similar to American English but with few exceptions (see [[Canadian English]]). The American spelling in Canada is sometimes used, but traditionally, the British Spelling (with the exceptions of some words like programme, -isation/-ise/-isable, chilli, etc.) is used. Although Commonwealth English is the most spoken, American English is seen more often on the internet. American English vocabulary dominates the visual media: &quot;movies&quot; (British: &quot;films&quot;) and television.

All [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations and Africa learn Commonwealth English, while American English is often learnt in the Americas and China. Z pronounced 'Zee' is only seen in the U.S.A and less commonly in Canada, while Z pronounced 'Zed' is spoken almost everywhere else. The United Kingdom and Ireland use British layout keyboards, while Australia, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S.A use American layout keyboards. In continental [[Europe]] [[English as a second language]] is nowadays sometimes even taught in American English, except perhaps in [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Netherlands]].

The word '''being''' means a living [[person]] or [[animal]]. &quot;Human being&quot; means the same as &quot;person&quot;. [[man|Men]], [[woman|women]], and [[child]]ren are [[human being]]s.

Some people write stories or make [[movie]]s about beings from other [[planet]]s. Most [[religion]]s talk about [[supernatural]] beings, for example [[spirit]]s, [[angel]]s, [[devil]]s, [[deity|gods]], or [[God]].

[[File:Beijing in China (+all claims hatched).svg|thumb|Beijing in China]]
[[File:Beijing Financial Street (overlook).jpg|thumb|Beijing]]

'''Beijing''' ({{lang-zh|北京}}, Běijīng) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The city used to be known as '''''[[Peking]]'''''.  It is in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. In 2008 Beijing hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]], and will host the 2022 [[Winter Olympic Games]]. It will be the only city to host both.

Beijing is well known for its ancient history.  Since the [[Jin Dynasty]], Beijing has been the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of several [[dynasties]] (especially the later ones), including the Yuan, Ming, and Qing. There are many places of historic interest in Beijing.  These places include the [[Summer Palace]] (Yìhéyuán), the Temple of Heaven (Tiāntán), [[Tiananmen Square]] (Tiānānmén Guǎngchǎng), the [[Forbidden City]] (Zǐjìnchéng), and the [[Great Wall of China]] (Chángchéng).

== What This Means==
Beijing simply means &quot;the northern capital&quot; in the [[Chinese language]].  It was once a counterpart of [[Nanjing]], &quot;the southern capital&quot;, during the Ming Dynasty.  This dynasty gave Beijing its name.  When the city did not serve as the capital city, the city reverts to its original name of Beiping, &quot;northern peace&quot;; this occurred between 1928 and 1949 when Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China.

== History ==
The center of Beijing was settled in the [[1st millennium BC]]. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (燕, Yān) set up their capital where Beijing is today.&lt;ref name=&quot;CD History&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Beijing-History.html |title=History - Beijing |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called it Ji (蓟, Jì). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.

Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by [[Mongol]] forces in [[1215]].  Then in [[1267]], Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it &quot;Great Capital&quot; (大都, Dàdū), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When [[Kublai Khan]] the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.

The [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]] all made Beijing their capital. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again.

In 1989, there were [[protest]]s in [[Tiananmen Square|Tian'anmen Square]] because some people wanted [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CD History&quot; /&gt;

== Education ==
Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China. More than 500 famous universities of China are in Beijing.  They also include 5 of the top universities: [[Peking University]], Tsinghua University, China People University, Beijing Normal University, and Beihang University. Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect, so over 70% foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies.

The word '''berry''' is used for many different kinds of small [[fruit]]s that have many [[seeds]] and can be used as food. Some examples are [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]], [[blueberry]] and [[lingonberry]].

When [[botany|botanists]] talk about ''berries'', they mean a simple [[fruit]] produced from a single [[gynoecium|ovary]]. They sometimes call this ''true berry'', to distinguish it from ''false berries''. By that statement of how words are used, [[grape]]s or [[tomato]]es are true berries.

The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the [[pericarp]] which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have an upper ovary with one or more [[carpel]]s. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary.

Berries are small, sweet, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more [[animal]]s towards them and spread their [[seed]]s.

Some fruits that are called ''berries'' in [[English language|English]] are not ''true berries'' by the use of words above. These include strawberries, [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[cranberry|cranberries]], and [[boysenberry|boysenberries]]. Some true berries do not have ''berry'' in their name. These include [[tomato]]es, [[eggplant]]s, [[guava]]s, [[pomegranate]]s and [[chile pepper|chillies]]. [[Pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[melon]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]]s are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names ([[pepo]] for pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons, or [[hesperidium]] for oranges and lemons).

A '''beard''' is the [[hair]] growing on the lower part of a [[man]]'s [[face]].

The hair that grows on the upper [[lip]] of some men is a [[mustache]].  When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin, it is called a [[soul patch]].  Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men [[shave]] part or all of their beards, or cut their beard so it does not get very long. Women can also have beards, but it is less common. 

Some [[animal]]s also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a '''beard'''.

In light, '''black''' is lack of all [[color]].  In [[painting]], however, the black [[pigment]] is the combination of all colors.  In [[heraldry]], black is called &quot;sable&quot;.

==Origin of ''black''==
The word black comes from Old English blæc (&quot;black, dark&quot;, also, &quot;ink&quot;), from Proto-Germanic *blakkaz (&quot;burned&quot;), and from Proto-Indo-European *bhleg-. In many languages, ''black'' has the same meaning as ''ink''.

==Black in science==
In science, an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it. Because these objects do not reflect any light, the human [[eye]] can't see any color coming from that object. The [[brain]] then sees these objects as black.


A way to create black objects is to mix [[pigment|pigments]]. A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment. For example, a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue. By mixing pigments in the right quantities, black can be made.


Because black objects absorb light, they become warmer faster.

== Meaning of black ==

Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, [[anarchy]], birth, male, and mystery. Black is a dark color, the darkest color there is. Black, along with gray and white, is a ''neutral'' color. This means that it is not a ''hot'' color or a ''cool'' color.

Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown (black holes). It can have a bad meaning (blacklist, 'black birth', black bat) or a good meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and power. It can be a [[formal]], elegant, and high-class color (black tie, black Mercedes, black man). Black clothing is common in [[emo]] and [[goth subculture]].

'''Bubonic plague''' is the best-known form of the disease [[plague]], which is caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. The name ''bubonic plague'' is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the [[lymphatic system]]. 

If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days. The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the [[Black Death]], which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0310_040310_blackdeath.html|title=Bubonic Plague Traced to Ancient Egypt|first=Cameron|last=Walker|publisher=National Geographic News|date=10 March, 2004|accessdate=2 April, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symptom]]s of this disease include [[cough]]ing, [[fever]], and black spots on the [[skin]].

== Different kinds of the same disease ==
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of [[flea]], that lives on [[rat]]s. Then there is an [[incubation period]] which can last from a few hours to about seven days. 
=== [[Septicemic plague]] ===
[[Sepsis]] happens when the bacterium enters the [[blood]] and makes it form tiny clots.
=== [[Pneumonic]] plague ===
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.

=== The abortive form ===
This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little [[fever]]. After that, there are [[antibody|antibodies]] that protect against all forms for a long time.

== History ==
During the 1300s, this [[epidemic]] struck parts of [[Asia]], [[North Africa]], and [[Europe]]. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike [[wikt:catastrophe|catastrophe]]s that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an [[Italy|Italian]] writer of the time, described it: ''&quot;This [[wikt:scourge|scourge]] had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers [[wikt:abandon|abandon]]ed brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;The decameron / Giovanni Boccaccio ; translated by Mark Musa &amp; Peter Bondanella ; with an introduction by Thomas G. Bergin. ISBN 0-451-52866-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission ==
[[File:Flea infected with yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental rat flea]] (''Xenopsylla cheopis'') infected with the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' [[Bacteria|bacterium]] which appears as a dark mass in the gut. The foregut of this flea is blocked by a ''Y. pestis'' [[biofilm]]; when the flea attempts to feed on an uninfected [[Host (biology)|host]] ''Y. pestis'' from the foregut is [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] into the wound, causing [[infection]].]]
The plague was not just carried by [[rat]]s as some people assume. The [[flea]]s also carried it. It came from abroad, from [[Kaffa]] by the [[Black Sea]]. From there the disease started to go new places in [[1347]]. It went to [[England]] in [[1349]]. There it killed '''half''' of the people in England. 70% of people who got plague died. Pigs are also to blame for the transmission, as the bacteria stayed in their blood system, and when eaten, people caught the plague. This is a reason why so few Jews or Muslims caught the disease.

== Modern history ==
In the [[20th century]], some countries did [[research]] on the [[bacteria]] that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for [[biological warfare]].

Samples of this [[bacteria]] are carefully controlled. There is much [[paranoia]] (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a [[United States|US]] expert in this [[organism]] was charged in October [[2003]] by the [[FBI]] with various [[crime]]s. This happened after he said he lost samples of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.

'''Biology''' is the [[science]] that studies life and living things, and their [[evolution]]. Living things include [[animal]]s, [[plants]], [[fungi]] (such as [[mushroom]]s), and [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].

The term 'biology' is relatively modern. It was introduced in 1802,&lt;ref&gt;Treviranus, Gottfried Reinhold 1802/22. ''Biologie oder die Philosophie der lebenden Nature''. &lt;/ref&gt; and was immediately adopted by [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck|Lamarck]].&lt;ref&gt;de Lamark, J.B. 1802. ''Hydrologie''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

People who study biology are called [[biologists]]. Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how [[organism]]s react with each other and the [[environment]]. It has existed as a [[science]] for about 200 years, and was preceded by [[natural history]]. Biology has many [[research]] fields and [[branch]]es. Like all sciences, biology uses the [[scientific method]]. This means that biologists must be able to show [[evidence]] for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.

Biology attempts to answer questions such as:
&quot;What are the characteristics of this living thing?&quot; ([[comparative anatomy]]);
&quot;How do the parts work?&quot; ([[physiology]]);
&quot;How should we group living things?&quot; ([[Biological classification|classification]], [[taxonomy]]);
&quot;What does this living thing do?&quot; ([[behaviour]], [[growth]]);
&quot;How does [[inheritance]] work? ([[genetics]]); &quot;What has been the history of life?&quot; ([[palaeontology]]). How do organisms relate to their [[environment]]? ([[ecology]]). All modern biology is influenced by [[evolution]], which answers the question: &quot;How has the living world come to be as it is?&quot;
